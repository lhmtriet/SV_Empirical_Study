to my problem  i cannot abandon my users they make up 25% of the userbase this is a custom app written for a customer designed to work on ie6  it is not an option to abandon ie6sp0/sp1  it s not an option to tell my customers to just deal with it it leaks so fast that after five minutes some of the weaker machines are unusable  further while i d love to become a js ninja so i can hunt down obscure memory leaks in jquery code granted this is ms s fault not jquery s i don t see that happening either   finally multiple people have reproduced the problem here and on the mailing list if you can t repro it you might have ie6sp2+ or you might not be refreshing enough  obviously this issue is very important to me hence the 6 revisions bounty etc. so i m open to new ideas but please keep in mind that none of those three suggestions will work for me  thanks to all for your consideration and insights please keep them coming!   update 7  the bounty has ended and keith s answer was auto-accepted by so i m sorry that only half the points were awarded since i didn t select the answer myself but i m still really stuck so i think half is fair   i am hopeful that the jquery/jquery-ui team can fix this problem but i m afraid that i ll have to write this off as impossible for now and stop using some or all of jquery thanks to everyone for your help and consideration if someone comes along with a real solution to my problem please post and i ll figure out some way to reward you,can you try this demo  here  it uses the same method as dojo implements to remove elements from the dom some quick testing it seems to ease the leaks not fully but much better   update  after spending a little time on this i am convinced it is nothing to do with the datepicker itself   my tests show that by just reloading a dummy page every 1 second sees ie leaking memory.if you then include jquery on this page the leaks increase slightly overhead of parsing the script if you then add jquery-ui into the mix then again there is another slight increase in memory leakage   to prove this if you avoid reloading the page and instead have a button that just adds an input creates the datepicker on it then removes it you see very little if any leaks  the problem here lies a bit deeper than  just  jquery jquery along with many other browsers leak circular references between dom objects and object listeners say you have an input field that has attached to it a listener then you remove the element from the dom and do not have any reference to the listener in your code now any modern browser >=ie7 ff chrome safari opera will live with that and garbage collect it while ie6 will think that because there is a listener attached to a dom element it should not garbage collect the dom  and  the listener itself  to get around that some folks use very complicated design patterns as highlighted for example in  events code  in google doctype to fix the problem for ie6 you would really need to rewrite a portion of jquery to work around ie6 issue and/or switch to using a different library and/or not attach any event listeners in your application to dom events   take a look at this snippet that cleans up dom nodes you may find it useful  https://stackoverflow.com/a/9519996/139667   the problem with ie 6 is that it has two garbage collectors  one for javascript and one for the dom so for example if you attach a function to a dom event and then delete the dom element the function will still exist in memory  check out this  slide show   it s a bit tongue in cheek but it s good information  they  fixed this issue  in ie 7 i tried your page in ie8 in windows 7 and i m not seeing a memory leak  try deleting these objects after destroying the datepicker object   this problem is either in a ie6-only part of jquery or in a general part of jquery that is lacking ie6 especific code as noted in the comments either way it s still a bug in jquery that needs addressing.about:blankyou ll either have to  dig yourself into jquery  or  file a bug ticket  if you manage to fix it don t forget to attach a diff to the bugtracker so the project gets a little bit better ;   if i get some spare time i ll try to help you with this  edit  ok so the problem seems unsurmountable  the leak you are facing is an ie 6 sp 0 only problem a leak caused by ie s approach to dom doesn t matter what js framework you use it refuses to work correctly  so your current options are    die trying  to get your users to upgrade ie 6 to a newer version/service pack  die as in leak in ie loosing customers or  die trying to work on ie   but that doesn t necesarily means you can t work this out what about just trying to side pass the wole thing?  show every non ie 6 sp 0 user the jquery datepicker and only ie 6 sp 0 another more resilient and probably basic datepicker with ie s  conditional comments  this way you can keep the eye candy/functionality in your software and allow ie 6 users to have the same basic functionality  it might not be such a clean option but you d still be able to use what you want and ie6 will still be able to work without leaking   the  only  problem will be that you ll have a bigger burden by having to degug two distinct datepickers but you ll have to debug ie 6 anyway so it may be your best bet at the moment  it s obvious that the problems you ve been describing stem from a flaw in ie6 that you can t subvert with a software fix be it a jquery update a manual call to collectgarbage or some other javascript/dom hack  there are 3 options in my mind that would fix this problem    i would imagine that your customers/users are using ie6 sp0 because of some company standard or regulation or even because some older web-app they still use doesn t support newer browsers if it s not an option to upgrade to ie7 or therefore ie8 you could get in contact with your customers  it department and politely point out that updating ie6 with the latest service packs would not only fix a problem with an application that they are paying for but also patch many security and performance flaws that undoubtedly exist in ie6 sp0 admittedly that might not be a comfortable situation but it might solve the problems you are encountering while still allowing them to work with a browser that require for whatever reason    if you can convince your customers  it department that ie6 is antiquated they may be willing to allow your users to upgrade to a newer browser it s not a stretch to say that someone running an it department would be more willing to force employees to upgrade a piece of software if they knew it was either a riddled with flaws and security holes or b approaching its end of support date as ie6 sp0 is ie6 sp0 on xp pro sp2 is supported until july 13 2010 - so it still has some time but pointing that out along with other flaws/limitations you could find might make them think seriously about upgrading sooner rather than later    if you can t convince anyone to upgrade their browsers either to ie6 spx or to ie7/8 then i don t know if you have a choice but to remove the offending control from your page and pursue a different option until the user s browser permits it there are assuredly many implementations of a date picker control available online which would suit your needs it might not be as snazzy as the jquery version but you don t have many other options at this point    i hope you find a solution!  i hate to say this your approach is correct and professional but i d be tempted to just leave it  the consequences of not fixing this is that ie6 users will notice their machine getting slower and slower and ultimately either crashing completely or more likely crashing ie6  so what?  really -  why is this your problem?   yours definitely won t be the only site they visit with this leak and they will see ie6 crash regularly regardless of what you do because that s what it does   it s unlikely that anyone still on ie6 could even point out your application as one that leaks   finally when ie6 does crash it reports ie6 as the culprit - you can legitimately point out that this is a bug in ie6 that microsoft have fixed in a new release  your expensive time is better spent on improving the application for the users not trapped in legacy hell - your app should basically work for ie6 users but this sort of issue can suck away all of your time and not fix their problem ie6 is still going to be an unsupported crash ridden security hole of a browser  i suspect the jquery devs take a similar view to me also you have to do some really ugly stuff to get round this bug in ie6 including hacky dom work that stops the leak but is actually much slower    update   ok this isn t an easy problem to fix - ms describe the ie6 bug and provide advice on how to fix it here  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250448vs.85.aspx   basically this isn t a problem with javascript or jquery - the actual issue is with the ie6 dom - when html elements are added to the page by javascript rather than being in the page when it loads ie can t garbage collect them unless they are created in a very specific way  this is back to front from how jquery ui builds elements see dom insertion order bug in the link above and so this isn t something that either the jquery devs or you can easily fix  so how do you fix the issue? well you can stick with the legacy pop-up calendar for ie6 or you can write your own one   i would recommend the former but if you really want to built the latter there are some basic rules to follow    always add elements top-down - for instance if you want to built a table add the   element into the page s dom then add   then   and so on this is back to front as it s much quicker to build the entire table and then add it to the dom - unfortunately that s where ie6 loses track of it    only use css and html 3.2 attributes - sounds dumb but ie6 creates extra objects to store the extra attributes or  expando  properties and these also leak    kinda related to 2 but as @gradbot mentions ie6 has problems garbage collecting javascript variables - if they reference a dom element inside an event fired from that element you can get problems this is also compounded by javascript references to dom elements that have  expando  properties    if you have a look around online there may already be a drop-down dhtml calendar that sticks to these rules - it won t be as pretty quick or configurable as the jquery ui one but i m sure i ve seen it done without leaking in ie6  i think the best bet is to keep as much static as possible - for instance you could load the calendar grid week numbers and day column headings with the page and then dynamically load in the numbers and nothing else create the day numbers as links with javascript in the href - not best practice normally but far less likely to leak in ie6  the best debugger available for ie6 is visual studio  even the free edition will work.  as janie mentions if your problem is only happening on ie6 you ll want to debug on ie6 paying special attention to code that only runs there,hate say approach correct

 cors is about getting content back not just making the request when you get a resource through an img or script tag you can trick someone s browser into making a csrf style request this is normal and you can protect against that with a normal csrf token  with cors enabled on all domains you can now have javascript on an attacking site make a request and get back the content invading their privacy  example  imagine your back enables cors for all domains now i make a website that makes a request to yourimaginarybank.com/balance  an img request would do nothing because my javascript can t get what was in the html of that page on your bank s website now that they have turned on cors the javascript on my site actually gets back an html page with your balance on it and saves it to my server not only can i make a get request like before but now i can see what is inside this is a huge security problem  how to solve the problem without adding a big list into your headers? each cors request is made with the origin header the best solution is probably to read the origin header then query a database to see if it is whitelisted as suggested by fritz in his answer  best practice is to first check the domain of the incoming request and then generate the response header depending on whether this domain is allowed to send requests you add it just this one to the   response header  afaik it is not even possible to add more than one domain to this header so it s either   or one specific domain and i would always prefer not to add    you can send more than one like   but i would advise against it instead keep a whitelist of allowed domains lets say   then if you get a request from   you respond with   if you get a request from   you respond with   if you get a request from a domain that is not allowed respond with an error or no cors policy  all xhr requests will send an   header so use that and you only need to send the cors policy headers for the   request not the   request that follows   the main issue i see is that you expose all your domains maybe you have a secure admin domain like   or maybe you have a product website that isn t ready for launch yet you don t want to include anything that isn t absolutely necessary for the request at hand  and   is just extremely lazy   cross-site request forgery attacks are far and away the primary concern that access-control-allow-origin addresses  ryan is certainly correct regarding content retrieval however on the subject of making the request there is more to say here many web sites now provide restful web services that expose a wide range of features that may involve making significant changes in the backend very often these restful services are intended to be invoked with an xhr e.g ajax request probably with a  single page application  as the front-end if a user has an active session granting access to these services when they visit a malicious third-party site that site may try to invoke those rest endpoints behind the scenes passing in values that could compromise the user or the site depending on how the rest services are defined there are various ways to protect against this  in the specific case of rest web services for a single page app you can dictate that all requests to the backend rest endpoints are made with xhr and refuse any non-xhr request you can dictate this by checking for the presence of a custom request header something like jquery s x-requested-with only xhr-type requests can set these headers simple get and post requests from forms and embedded resources cannot finally the reason that we want to dictate xhr requests gets us back to the original question - xhr requests are subject to cors rules   if you allowed   then any site could make any ajax request on the user s behalf to your rest endpoints if your rest endpoints involve any kind of sensitive data or allow for data persistence then this is an unacceptable security vulnerability instead enforce xhr-only requests like i described and define a whitelist of origins allowed to make those requests  it s worth pointing out that if your rest endpoints do not expose any sensitive information or if they don t allow the user to make any persistent data changes then   may be the appropriate decision google maps for instance provides read-only views into public map data there is no reason to restrict the third party sites that may wish to invoke those services  old question but a lot of bad answers here so i have to add mine  if you don t set   and you do cookie-less authentication ie the caller supplies a bearer authorization header then you don t need to whitelist origins  just echo the origin back in    a well-structured rest api can be called safely from any origin,except one none repli answer origin question answer question seem long set secur problem make wonder spec requir preflight set,,attacks|protection|vulnerability|sensitive data|denial of service|sensitive information|cross site request forgery,7,18,1076,0.016728625,2013-10-11 16:29:07.157 UTC,DH,Wants to know the security implications of adding all domains to CORS (rather than just a set). ,SA,States that none of the answers sufficiently answer their question

  no  any similarity even a complex correlation would be considered a weakness in the hash once discovered by the crypto community it would be published and enough discovered weaknesses in the hash eventually add up to advice not to use that hash any more  of course there s no way to know whether a hash has undiscovered weaknesses or weaknesses known to an attacker but not published in which case most likely the attacker is a well-funded government organization the nsa certainly is in possession of non-public theoretical attacks on some crypto components but whether those attacks are usable is another matter gchq probably is i d guess that a few other countries have secret crypto programs with enough mathematicians to have done original work china would be my first guess all you can do is act on the best available information and if the best available information says that a hash is good for crypto then one of the things that means is no usable similarities of this kind  finally some systems use weak hashes for passwords -- either due to ignorance by the implementer or legacy all bets are off for the properties of a hashing scheme that either hasn t had public review or else has been reviewed and found wanting or else is old enough that significant weaknesses have eventually been found md5 is broken for some purposes since there exist practical means to generate collisions but not for all purposes afaik it s ok for this in the sense that there is no practical pre-image attack and having a handful of hashes of related plaintexts is no better than having a handful of hashes of unrelated plaintexts but for unrelated reasons you shouldn t really use a single application of any hash for password storage anyway you should use multiple rounds   could a hacker increase their chances of brute-forcing the password if they have a list of hashes of similar passwords?   indirectly yes knowing that those are your old passwords not because of any property of the hash but suppose the attacker manages to very slowly brute-force one or more of your old passwords using those old hashes and sees that in the past it has been thisismypassword3 and thisismypassword4  your password has since changed to thisismypassword5 well done by changing it before the attacker cracked it you have successfully ensured that the attacker did not recover a valuable password! victory! except it does you no good since the attacker has the means to guess the new one quickly anyway using the old passwords  even if the attacker only has one old password and therefore cannot easily spot a trend password crackers work by trying passwords which are similar to dictionary words and other values to over-simplify a bit it will try the dictionary words first then strings consisting of a word with one extra character added removed or changed then strings with two changes and so on  by including your old password in the other values the attacker can ensure that strings very similar to it are checked early in the cracking process so if your new password is similar to old ones then having the old hashes does have some value to the attacker - reversing any one of them gives him a good seed to crack your current password  so incrementing your password regularly doesn t add much changing your password to something that s guessable from the old password puts your attacker in the same position as they d be in if they knew nothing at all but your password was guessable from nothing at all  the main practical attacks on password systems these days are eavesdropping via keyloggers and other malware and phishing trying to reverse password hashes isn t a good percentage attack although if an attacker has somehow got hold of an /etc/passwd file or equivalent they  will  break some weak passwords that way on the average system  short answer no!  the output of a hash function varies greatly even if one character is increased  but this is only if you want to break the hashfunction itself  of course it is bad practice since it makes bruteforcing easier  no if you check the password even slightly it produces completely new hash   as a general rule a good hash will not hash two similar but unequal strings to similar hashes md5 is good enough that this isn t a problem however there are rainbow tables essentially password:hash pairs for quite a few common passwords and for some password hashes the traditional des-based unix passwords for example full rainbow tables exist  with a good hash algorithm similar passwords will get distributed across the hashes so similar passwords will have very different hashes  you can try this with md5 and different strings   it depends on the hashing algorithm if it is any good similar passwords should not have similar hashes  it depends on the hash algorithm used a good one will distribute similiar inputs to disparate outputs  to expand on what others have said a quick test shows that you get vastly different hashes with small changes made to the input  i used the following code to run a quick test   and i got the following results,similar password similar hashes?

how can i solve it properly?  security scheme rationale briefly i thought  the file will be able to carry out arbitrary commands inside itsenvironment so it is comparable to a shell script  there was a security hole on free desktops with .desktop files that defineapplications the file may specify any executable with arguments andit may choose its own icon and name so a randomly downloaded file could hidebehind any name or icon and do anything that was bad  this was solved by requiring that .desktop files have the executable bitset otherwise they will not be rendered with name/icon and the free desktopwill ask the user if it wants to start the program before commencing  compare this to mac os x s very good design this program has been downloaded from the web,are you sure you want to open it?  so in allegory with this and the fact that you have to   shell scripts that you download i thought about the design in the question above  closing words  maybe in conclusion maybe we should keep it simple if the file must be executable make it executable and let the kernel execute it when invoked by the user delegation of the task to where it belongs",another way to do it is to change the file name to something unexpected or even copy the entire file - if it s not too big - to a temp dir encrypted if necessary make you checks then rename / copy the file back  of course it s a very heavy process  but you end up with that because the system has not been set for safety from the beginning a safe program would sign or encrypt data he wants to keep safe in your case it s not possible  unless you realy on heavy encrypting there is not way to ensure 100 safety on a machine you don t control  you should change the files ownership such that an attacker cannot access it chown root:root file_name  do a chmod 700 file_name so that no other accounts can read/write/execute the file   this avoids the problem of a toctou all together and this is how people prevent files from being modified by an attacker who has a user account on your system   you cannot entirely solve this race condition -- e.g in the version where you first open then check permissions it s  possible  that the permissions get changed just after you ve opened the file and just before you ve changed the permissions  if you can atomically move the file to a directory where the potential bad guys can t reach then you can rest assured that nothing about the file will be changed from under your nose while you re dealing with it  if the potential bad guys can reach  everywhere  or you can t move the file to where they can t reach there s no defense  btw it s not clear to me how this scheme even if it could be made to work would actually add any security -- surely if the bad guys can put poisoned content in the file it s not beyond them to   it as well?  the best you can do is    save the permission  change it to your own unique user something with the program name and forbid others to run it  make you checks on the saved permission if needed  run your process  set back the permission to the saved ones   of course there are drawbacks but if your use case is as simple as you seem to say it could do the trick  the executability is attached to the file you open there is nothing stopping several files from pointing to the inode containing the data you wish to read in other words the same data may be readable from a non-executable file elsewhere in the same filesystem furthermore even after opening the file you can t prevent the executability of that same file from changing it could even be unlinked  the best effort available to you as i see it would be do checks using   on the opened file and check protection mode and modification time before and after but at best this will only reduce the possibility that changes go undetected while you read the file  on second thoughts if you re the original creator of the data in this file you could consider writing an inode that s never linked to the filesystem in the first place this a common technique in memory sharing via files alternatively if the data contained must eventually made public to other users you could use file locking and then progressively extend the protection bits to those users that require it  ultimately you must ensure malicious users simply don t have write access to the file,execut attach file open noth stop sever file point inod contain data wish read word data may readabl non-execut file elsewher filesystem furthermor even open file prevent execut file chang could even unlink best effort avail see would check use open file check protect mode modif time best reduc possibl chang go undetect read file second thought origin creator data file could consid write inod never link filesystem first place common techniqu memori share via file altern data contain must eventu made public user could file lock progress extend protect bit user requir ultim must ensur malici user simpli write access file,,toctou|poison|attacks|protection|race condition,5,12,906,0.013245033,2010-02-13 16:29:09.397 UTC,HT,Wants to know how to avoid a race condition,"Ex, AT",Explains a bit about the functionality.

the two functions   and   i assume these are safe but without indepth knowledge i don t feel certain some simple google-searches reveals at least that there has been vulnerabilities in the past as part of the assignment is to try to break the other groups systems it is important both that our own system is safe and to find possible vulnarabilites in the other group s systems and most of the groups will use these two functions blindly so my questions are   is there any known vulnerabilities in  ?  is there any known vulnerabilities in  ?  is there a natural place to search for such vulnerabilities other than asking stackoverflow,first i would recommend that you use  mysqli prepared statements  these are  more secure  than the escape functions as it entirely separates the query structure from the query parameters  you can use  either  strip_tags or htmlentities to make certain that no malicious code is being output to the browser you ll also probably want to run  all  dynamic content through some sort of filter function before outputting it to the browser this is one area where a well-organized and cohesive oo approach can help because you can assign all dynamic content to a single object which is then responsible for rendering the output to the browser so that you can always feel safe knowing that your content is xss safe without having to search through hundreds of echo statements across multiple pages  however these two suggestions really only touch the tip of the iceberg when it comes to php security there are a number of other issues that have to also be dealt with such as    secure session management    session fixation    i would recommend that you take a look at the following sites for additional and more comprehensive treatment on the topic of php security    shiflett.org    phpsecurity.org  this is another chris shiflett site but i m not certain whether he has additional content here that isn t on his personal site   phpsec.org  not as much content there as i would like but there are some useful things to know such as making certain configuration files that contain sensitive information like database passwords are not stored in publicly available directories   on that final item if it is possible you will want to look into using .htaccess files or their iis equivalent to make certain only the files you intend access to are publicly available otherwise all of your other security measures will be vain   update  i thought of a couple other issues relating to security in your project if you remember the unfortunate incident with a twitter administrator s account being hacked a little bit ago it was allowed to happen for several reasons that could have all been easily resolved   1 password log in attempts where not throttled in other words if a user attempts to log in and fails then a repeat request from their ip might require 2 seconds to process the second time then 4 the next and so on this makes it impractical for a bot to make continuous log in attempts 2 secure passwords were not required as passwords have higher requirements length and types of characters required such as alphanumeric and special characters then dictionary attacks become altogether impractical because it is much easier to throw a dictionary at hacking a password than it is to come up with random strings of numbers and letters also the amount of time crack a password increases exponentially as more characters are added  you can see  this post  from jeff atwood for more information on this particular topic  for php

7094035,so,11,0.48918646600000004,java|maven|security,how secure is using maven,what are the risks and possibilities or scenarios whereby someone sets up masquerades of maven repositories and/or ip streams to provide masqueraded library copies of the original but injected with malicious or harmful code  what are the steps and practices to prevent such risks and possibilities,i can think of several scenarios though the first isn t maven-specific    dns cache poisoning  the dns data you use to get to the standard repositories could be poisoned causing maven to download artifacts from a different repository see  the wikipedia article on dns cache poisoning     non-standard repositories  any repository you add to your maven configuration could provide artifacts that include malicious code prevent this by using only those 3rd party repositories that you trust    repository poisoning  based on maven s  guide to uploading artifacts to the central repository  it looks like the central maven repository publishes artifacts from approved repository hosts so security of artifacts depends on the host i don t know specifics about the process of becoming an approved repository host but with so few listed it s probably onerous   in addition the central repo requires pgp signatures for all deployments so unless a malicious user gains access to the private key for a project i don t think this is possible    artifact modification during transmission man in the middle  maven does automatic checksum verification for all artifacts so the attacker would have to modify the artifact and the accompanying checksums to inject malicious code i don t know if you could prevent it completely but to make sure you re paying attention to checksums make sure your checksum policy isn t set to ignore see the  settings doc     as other commenters have mentioned a good way to prevent malicious code from getting into your production deployment is to only use an internal maven repository for production release builds by restricting access to the addition of dependencies to that repository you can make sure that they are all verified at whatever level you choose e.g checksum double-checking source scanning  if you use well-known repositories central maven repository jboss repository it is very low possibility of injecting harmful code computer virus your isp or isp of your isp to do so must to mess in dns servers or change routing paths for some set of destinations i think that s rather unlikely - the same is not only about maven repos but for all internet services email  http voip and so on what s more the same risk is with downloading jars directly from project sites. anyway if you want to have a total control you can set up your own maven repository http://nexus.sonatype.org/  every file available in the repository should have md5 or sha checksum generated - this way you can validate if what you downloaded is really what you wanted but - if the attacker virus is smart enough to intercept your data transfer and mess in jar files he will be also smart enough to intercept md5/sha checksums the defense against it is to provide pgp signatures both for checksums and artifacts - release artifacts uploaded to central repo are forced to do so .asc files   the good idea is to use nexus professional - you would be able to configure procurement suite to check pgp signature against a public key server each time artifact is downloaded more information about pgp signatures with maven can be found here   https://docs.sonatype.org/display/repository/how+to+generate+pgp+signatures+with+maven    http://www.sonatype.com/people/2012/03/the-first-line-of-defense-checksums-and-pgp-signatures-in-repositories/   i suppose a dedicated and resourceful attacker could perform an mitm attack and intercept all requests to public maven repositories carefully injecting malicious bytecode into the jar artifacts then recalculating and supplying the sha1 hashes  to the client it would appear as a legitimate artifact the binary jar and the sha1 match and will be the same even if they check alternate mirrors  i suppose the only real solution is to request the central repos to support https and trust that tls itself hasn t been broken  alternatively a practical approach might be to set up a maven proxy artifactory or nexus served over https to internal clients this reduces the attack surface and means that you ll just have to secure the communication lines from that server to the outside world i would periodically double check that the jars and hashes on the proxy match those on the public mirrors using a totally independent trusted network  if you really really want to be secure you wouldn t be trusting binariesEEEEEEEEinstead you d be downloading  all  source code and reviewing them  by hand  before compiling them yourselfEEEEEEEEbut that assumes you have enough qualified resources and time to conduct the reviews  and  trust your entire build tool chain to begin with  well security in layers as they always say,suppos dedic resourc attack could perform mitm attack intercept request public maven repositori care inject malici bytecod jar artifact recalcul suppli sha1 hash client would appear legitim artifact binari jar sha1 match even check altern mirror suppos real solut request central repo support http trust tls broken altern practic approach might set maven proxi artifactori nexu serv http intern client reduc attack surfac mean secur commun line server outsid world would period doubl check jar hash proxi match public mirror use total independ trust network realli realli want secur trust binariesEEEEEEEEinstead download sourc code review hand compil yourselfEEEEEEEEbut assum enough qualifi resourc time conduct review trust entir build tool chain begin well secur layer alway say,,virus|poison|attacks|malicious code|attack surface|man in the middle,6,16,797,0.020075282,2011-08-17 13:55:25.947 UTC,Co,Wants to know about Maven security.,"Ex, AT",Gives an explanation of general security concerns and describes preventative measures.

building any enterprise or any of your own software,you should just think like a hacker.as we know hackers are also not expert in all the things,but when they find any vulnerability they start digging into it by gathering information about all the things and finally attack on our software.so for preventing such attacks we should follow some well known rules like   always try to break your codesuse

to secure all parts but the attacker only has to succeed in finding one kink in your armour  security is an example of unknown unknowns sometimes you won t know what the possible security flaws are

widespread and critical programming errors that can lead to serious software vulnerabilities they are often easy to find and easy to exploit they are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software steal data or prevent the software from working at all      the top 25 list is a tool for education and awareness to help programmers to prevent the kinds of vulnerabilities that plague the software industry by identifying and avoiding all-too-common mistakes that occur before software is even shipped software customers can use the same list to help them to ask for more secure software researchers in software security can use the top 25 to focus on a narrow but important subset of all known security weaknesses finally software managers and cios can use the top 25 list as a measuring stick of progress in their efforts to secure their software   a good starter course might be the mit course in  computer networks and security   one thing

as the request in the controller will check if the user is authenticated has permission and that it has the correct form key  2. how can i use the security component with a get request in cakephp? presume i would also need to handle the routing as well,"for the first question  the reason probably lies in the definition of http methods   is defined as one of the safe methods which means that it can not be used for changing the state of the server but only for retrieving information you can read more on the http methods on  this link  since html forms are not capable of sending http   request the  workaround  is to use some of the available methods and if you rule out the   as a  safe method  it leaves   you can of course use   to delete stuff many do but   request is by convention expected not to change anything   edit  if you are interested to read more about http methods and browser/html support check out  this so question   see this  when you have the security component enabled and you use the formhelper methods for all forms you do not have to worry about this you also do not have to configure anything it works out of the box   for csrf you can use the following options    controls whether or not csrf tokens are use and burn set to false to not generate new tokens on each request one token will be reused until it expires this reduces the chances of users getting invalid requests because of token consumption it has the side effect of making csrf less secure as tokens are reusable  if you have everything on you should see the csrf tokens in the html of the form you can set any additional options you like but it will pretty much work out of the box for you   johhniedoe  pointed me to croogo 1.3 for an example of how they are have done something similar to what i asked in my question because 1.3 was targeted to cakephp prior to 2.x the code was a little out of date so i ve amended it as follows  first create the link in this case a delete link with the csrf token used by the security component passed as a parameter called     next i ve created a wildcard route connection to handle the token this isn t essential usually but because we re not using the named token and i wanted to keep the url cleaner   and then finally handle it in your method like so   this basically says if the token doesn t match then use the blackhole callback function   which i define in my appcontroller to show an error  one last thing to be aware of though is that you must allow the token to be used more than once and last for example an hour this is because otherwise the token will be reset and no longer match after the get request is sent   firstly cakephp uses post links to delete as an added level of security because lets say for example your authentication system is not 100% secure and users can access a delete method by manually typing in a url - if i go in and  type /users/delete/10   i can actually delete users on your server which is risky as you can imagine  secondarily get requests can be cached or bookmarked so users who bookmark these links could end up navigating to broken links which is never a good thing ,also sensitive data will be visible in the url so  for example if someone bookmarks a login page with the get variables intact - this could compromise there security  finally you can easily generate your own tokens using the following code    the above will use the salt key setup in your core config file but you can also replace true with a custom salt",johhniedo point croogo 1.3 exampl done someth similar ask question 1.3 target cakephp prior 2.x code littl date amend follow first creat link case delet link csrf token use secur compon pass paramet call next creat wildcard rout connect handl token essenti usual use name token want keep url cleaner final handl method basic say token match blackhol callback function defin appcontrol show error one last thing awar though must allow token use last exampl hour otherwis token reset longer match get request sent,stackoverflow.com,sensitive data|cross site request forgery,2,9,777,0.011583012,2013-08-13 16:48:01.27 UTC,DH,Wants clarifications and the security implications of request methods for the CakePHP framework,"Ex, CS",Explains the functionality the user asked about and provides some sample code for some additional functionality.

104543,sse,11,0.593725979,confidentiality|integrity|replay-detection|threat-modeling,why would a replay attack be considered a threat to integrity and not confidentiality,i came across a test where the instructions were to circle all the correct answers i m looking for an explanation to the answer for this question     question a  replay attack  is a threat against   answers 1 confidentiality 2 integrity 3 availability   correct 2 integrity   explanation attacker is faking the authentication process which is a  level of indirection   first of all is there a clear cut answer or is it more of an art interpreting the rules of cia? second isn t the data being stolen and nothing is getting written to? does it count as a write just falsely authenticating to a system,a replay attack is an attack where you record a legitimate transaction and then replay it at a later date  it is not an attack on confidentiality because the attacker isn t learning any new information he has the same data than what he recorded in the first place it might  lead  to an unauthorized access but that is a different issue  it is not an attack on availability because the target system will still be functioning normally again unless the replay attack opens up the way for a different kind of exploit  it is however a breach of the system integrity because it allowed an unauthorized transaction  the key defining factor of a replay attack is that the replay d message is treated as legitimate traffic and has some effect simply being able to replay a transaction isn t enough - it has to also look like regular traffic  for example say you have a programmable wireless car-key you have to type your password into both the key and at some point the car lets say  if the password is sent to the car in plaintext it is both vulnerable to confidentiality and integrity attacks your third criteria availability would be if you could jam/block the car-key or not  so say you encrypt the password with sha9000 and send that to the car eavedroppers can no longer see/decrypt your password and it s no longer vulnerable to confidentiality attacks but since your password hashes the same way every time it can simply be replayed  now imagine that you don t encrypt the password but you do send the password plus the current time of day now communications are no longer confidential but they are protected from  dumb  replay attacks i say dumb because the attacker knowing the protocol could easily replicate it knowing the password so we haven t got true integrity protection yet but its a step in the right direction.unlike confidentiality attacks integrity attacks have a much broader spectrum of vulnerability it s often not all or nothing but somewhere in between certain kinds of packets maybe or perhaps 60% of the time it s vulnerable every time if it s prng related.. it used to be a bit of a cat-and-mouse game with protocols having all sorts of weird checksums etc to ensure it was a legitimate device sending them but attackers would eventually learn and dupe the protocol.. early security jobs mainly focused on communication integrity  then the wide-spread adoption of encryption changed all that because everything wrapped in a layer of encryption carries the authenticity of the encryption too  for example in our car-key example if you concatenate the password and the time of day together into a single string and encrypt that you can get integrity and confidentiality in one  the question is usually a distraction and a rat-hole  ci &amp a are goals for properties that system designers aim for  a replay is a type of attack  assuming that there is a perfect mapping between attacks and goals gets people tied up in knots  in threat modeling people often try to categorize attacks they ve discovered according to stride and get caught up in questions like this  stride is a mnemonic for violations of aincaa a super-set of cia.  the question i encourage them to ask is what good does it do to categorize in that way? and i ve never in a decade of teaching threat modeling heard a good answer  stephane s analysis is good a replay attack is a violation of integrity and that can help you decide you need authentication controls in the protocol or system  however you can get that answer in many easier ways,replay attack attack record legitim transact replay later date attack confidenti attack learn new inform data record first place might lead unauthor access differ issu attack avail target system still function normal unless replay attack open way differ kind exploit howev breach system integr allow unauthor transact,,attacks|exploit|protection|vulnerability,4,28,740,0.037837838,4/11/2015 5:28,Co,Wants explanation of the impact vectors of replay attacks,Ex,Explains the impacts of replay attacks

 and if you think that bad deployment practices can t possibly be a life threatening problem for my business then i invite you to google knight capital group     how did they find this file?   by very simple brute force guesswork as others have already mentioned  you will be able to see this as it happened the request for this file along with the other guesses that were made in your web server s logs unless of course the testers managed to find a hold that allowed them to reset your logs which would be listed in your test report or you didn t have sufficient logging enabled     but being a less-predictable-renamer is probably not a bad idea either   it is good practise to avoid old files being in your application directory  at all  even in your source directories especially if your deployment model is copy from source  instead of keeping old versions of files around for reference or other reasons make use of the features offered by your version control arrangement all vcss will let you retrieve older versions of files some will let you shelve intermediate versions without properly checking them in you can use branching to separate out experimental work etc  brute force scanners  many automated scanners get around banned directory listings by bruteforce searching for files this means that they will check for additional files with names similar to files that do exist i.e   as well as files that aren t referenced at all aka   if you happen to have a file whose name is on the bruteforced list and is in an accessible directory then it will be found regardless of whether or not directory listing is enabled   it s worth pointing out that hackers do this same thing so this is a real issue in general if something is in a publicly accessible directory then you should assume it will be found so if you don t want it to be public then you need to keep it out of public directories - disabling directory listing provides very little security  real vulnerabilities  finally this may not seem like a large issue and it probably isn t but leaving backups of javascript files in public directories is actually a bad idea in general  when it comes to xss an attacker will generally have the most success if they are able to exploit a javascript file hosted on the same domain  this is because doing so gives opportunities to bypass a csp or other security firewalls  as a result if an older javascript file happened to have a security vulnerability in it that was fixed in a later version and an attacker found a way to force the user s browser to load the older javascript file they may chain their way to a more damaging vulnerability  this may seem far fetched but chaining together many small vulnerabilities into a larger one is how many of the worst breaches happen     tl/dr if something is hosted by your website but doesn t have a  reason to be there then it is a liability  kill it with prejudice   there are many tools available which brute-force filenames some of these are more intelligent than others  for instance a dumb tool may just have a word list containing probable names for files and directories such as             a more intelligent tool may look at the files which it already knows about e.g by crawling the application and try to find similarly-named files in your case there was a file named   so the application likely tried to mangle the name as tripehound pointed out in a comment                why are these files a problem?  one might be tempted to think that an unreferenced file is safe because it s not a part of the application however the file is still accessible and depending on the contents of the file this may allow an attacker to do various things   an attacker might be able to circumvent an url filter and include a javascript file that still contains vulnerabilities from an older version  unreferenced files may be archives that are left over from deployment and still contain source code thus allowing an attacker to gain access to that  unreferenced files may contain credentials or other relevant configuration data   in general it s best to avoid having unreferenced files in your webroot as the name implies they are not used by the application and thus are only a source of problems,brute forc scanner mani autom scanner get around ban directori list bruteforc search file mean check addit file name similar file exist i.e well file referenc aka happen file whose name bruteforc list access directori found regardless whether directori list enabl worth point hacker thing real issu gener someth publicli access directori assum found want public need keep public directori - disabl directori list provid littl secur real vulner final may seem larg issu probabl leav backup javascript file public directori actual bad idea gener come xss attack gener success abl exploit javascript file host domain give opportun bypass csp secur firewal result older javascript file happen secur vulner fix later version attack found way forc user browser load older javascript file may chain way damag vulner may seem far fetch chain togeth mani small vulner larger one mani worst breach happen tl/dr someth host websit reason liabil kill prejudic,,bypass|attacks|exploit|pen test|backdoor|vulnerability|penetration test|cross site scripting,8,19,993,0.019133938,27/08/2019 11:02,DC,Doesn't understand why pentest results contain a certain file,Ex,Explains reasons for it being picked up

i m after more details for this specific case,following your premise that the ssl connection has been established with the correct domain and assuming neither your server nor the browser has any vulnerabilities then the user has via your ssl certificate and his trusted root certificates verified that the page he loaded from your server arrived without tampering  i see the following gotchas    a man-in-the-middle attack is obviously possible if the interceptor can forge your ssl certificate so if you have shared it with your cdn? with the rogue admin at your web hoster? with the coworker who is legally prohibited from admitting he was subpoenaed for the keys? this is actually a possible attack vector it could also happen if you generated weak keys in the first place maybe your system was low on entropy or used a broken random number generator?    not a single one of the root cas the browser is configured to trust may be compromised note that there are typically lots and lots of them and only one compromise is required for the man-in-the-middle to forge an apparently valid ssl certificate for your domain also note that some users may be at the whim of their vendor who may like microsoft push new root ca certificates on demand theoretically permitting any lawful? man-in-the-middle attack that microsoft or any of the cas can be persuaded to support we can of course hope that only the good guys have that much power over corporations    even seemingly unrelated vulnerabilities can obviously negate the entire argument even those that may be called a feature rather than a bug imagine the man-in-the-middle initially serves a webpage over http that causes the browser to switch to fullscreen display and then imitates a typical browser window will your hypothetical super-dilligent user notice that the address bar and its contents are only an elaborate emulation of his browser s address bar...?    since the initial request was sent over http there are a large number of possible attack vectors available that do not depend on cookies or session state and would be unaffected by a subsequent redirect to https even with a server-supplied hsts header  while i m not a full-time web security specialist here s a list of possible attacks made possible when an attacker is able to mitm the original http request  1 send 301/302 redirects to intermediate urls to set up/install malware outside of the browser this can include keyloggers etc very valuable as the attacker can cherry pick victims going to a site of interest when the malware is deployed on the target a final browser redirect is sent as expected to the client and the movie goes on like nothing happened  2 use the same vehicle to attack the browser itself there is the opportunity here for the attacker to perform browser-specific actions like installing a malicious plugin   3 like above but exploit any holes available to change the browser configuration this could be used to enable information leakage via a covert channel like search hints or keyword completion or combine this with option 1 and configure the browser to proxy ssl through code executing locally  4 load the target ssl page in an iframe and exploit xss weaknesses in order to obtain and exploit session credentials once the victim logs in  there is a wide range of difficulties in the above scenarios and they all rely more or less on weaknesses in particular browser versions many of the scenarios may be more difficult than other easier attack vectors there is the utility of employing focused exploits depending on available information in the original request s headers like user-agent that could be attractive   i m sure there are other wide categories of attack i m missing but this is a start on exposure that an initial http to https session can open up   as mentionned above all cookies must be flagged as secure  owasp  but also if you expect your users to access to your site only through ssl then you should enable http strict transport security hsts -  wikipedia   the first will ensure that no cookie will be sent over a clear http connection the latter will ensure that any compatible browser will always after a first initial access use https to access the website even when the user type http the browser will automatically replace it by https without send any http request to the server  as well as @gzbk s and @adnan s excellent answers one other thing i ve thought of is the case of the application being vulnerable to  xss  on output of a cookie value  say normally the cookie value is output unencoded but as the cookie was normally set over https and would not be subject to mitm it was not a danger as the user could only attack themselves however if the http request was intercepted and the cookie was poisoned with an exploit for this  xss  vulnerability this could be a possible attack vector in this scenario   of course this is not the non https request including a redirect being vulnerable because this cookie could be set even if   did not listen on port 80 at all an attacker could mitm any other http request the victim made redirect them to   which the attacker also intercepts and returns the response to redirect the user to their original website but only after the   cookie has been poisoned     can i trust that from now on my session is not vulnerable to any man-in-the-middle attack?

dns server in an attempt to spoof google.com they will receive the response google.com is already in cache - so does the attacker have a chance to clear the data in the cache,cache management  is a broad subject half of the decisions taken by a dns server in how it handles its cache are purely local and thus non-standard  in the  dns  system servers which are authoritative for a zone say a domain publish some cache delays which apply restrictions to other servers for instance for     the numbers are in that order  serial   refresh   retry   expire  and  minimum  the serial is an arbitrary integer increased at each modification and traditionally encodes the date of the last modification here july 24th 2013 the four other integers are  delays  expressed in seconds they tell that a secondary e.g the dns server of an isp not the source dns server for the target domain should use the following strategy   whatever information was cached  should  be refreshed after two hours 7200 seconds in case newer information is obtained  in case of failure to reach the source dns a server should wait for half an hour 1800 seconds before trying again  information which was cached cannot be considered as usable beyond fourteen days 1209600 seconds a dns server must not use or keep information which has been obtained more than a fortnight before  unless it cannot be avoided a dns server must not talk again to the source dns server within five minutes 300 seconds of the previous answer   section 2.2 of  rfc 1912  gives more details the most important value for an attacker bent on dns poisoning is the minimum delay here it means that the attacker will have a hard time making its victim eat fake dns data about   before at least 5 minutes have elapsed conversely the attacker just has to wait for five minutes or maintain his toxic flow of fake answers for five minutes in order to have a fair chance at poisoning the server   there are methods to speed up forgetfulness  the attacker stands a chance of poisoning the server if he can get it to forget what it knows about a given domain as explained above a dns server will already forget information beased on delays which are advertised by the source server itself however a dns server keeps its cache in ram which is not an infinite resource this means that the following may be applicable    the attacker can spam the target dns with lots of requests for many randomly-chosen domains so that the dns has more information to cache than it can realistically keep in its allocated ram forcing it to evict previously cached information earlier than what the minimum delay would have entailed    in some cases the attacker can make the target dns crash and be restarted automatically it depends on how well the dns software and the underlying os handle against massive  dos attacks  a crashed-and-restarted dns server begins its life with a clean empty cache ready to be poisoned    dns servers can also agree on proactive notifications of changes a secondary dns can ask a primary to tell it whenever some of its data has changed so that it may invalidate its caches immediately instead of waiting for

12164,sse,11,0.6077883239999999,attacks|detection|ids,how effective is an ids at catching targeted attacks,i have recently become very familiar with ibm site protector as i understand things site protector is in the top tier of ips/ids systems used by some of the largest fortune 500 companies  i was surprised to see the high amount of false positives and the overall lack of tags that may be specific to indicating a targeted attack  i saw a network security analyst reporting many alerts raised that could be suspicious such as those relating to sql injection these dismissed by the analyst as false positives when inquiring as to how this could be ascertained in the software i was told there were no further specific labels/alert types to investigate  since there seem to be a lack of specific alerts i have to wonder how useful ids software at the highest level is at detecting specialized targeted attacks  to clarify the type of attack i am talking about i will give an example   port scans against a specific target  sql injection attempts against a specific target  credentials obtained such as from obtaining them from a database via succusfull sql injection  ssh installed or remote shell established some type of remote interface that should not be typical for the target  other anomalous behavior such as large amounts of traffic over non-standard ports from the target   from what i witnessed the sql_injection alert did not even show the parameters in the url only the file name in the url so it would be hard to even see if sql injection took place  if there are no alerts to that would show the activity in the attack scenario above and most sql injection and even buffer overflow alerts tend to be dismissed as a false positivewhen even one instance could be a successful attack how useful is using an ids to detect such an attack,"idss will probably be about as effective at detecting targeted attacks as non-targeted attacks  i wonder if there might be some misunderstanding about what a targeted attack is  the difference between a targeted attack and a non-targeted attack is in whether the attacker tries hacking everyone or hacking just you  targeted vs non-targeted is orthogonal from which technical method the attacker chooses to use in the attack  generally speaking ids is best used for detecting common low-sophistication attacks  however a sophisticated attacker can readily evade an ids  custom attacks are not likely to be detected by an ids  also an ids is not likely to detect advanced persistent threats apts  and a network-level ids is not likely to be very good at detecting spear phishing e.g targeted malicious emails targeted attacks through social networks and that sort of thing  email-based vectors probably need to be detected at your mailserver not by something that monitors your network  web-based vectors are even harder for a network monitor to detect  generally speaking i don t recommend relying upon an ids as your primary line of defense   it s ok as a secondary defense to catch some things that you might not have stopped with your primary defenses but you shouldn t use an ids as your only defense  your primary defense should use other methods e.g firewalls software updating/patching system configuration and administration user education good software development practices   disclaimer  ibm site protector is proprietary so i cannot answer specific questions about it  but i ll share my impression of network-based ids/ips systems in general   effectiveness at detecting certain attacks  you asked about how effective idss are at detecting certain specific kinds of attacks     port scans  i d expect ids systems to be pretty effective at detecting most port scans  it is a separate question whether it is useful to detect port scans.     sql scans  i d expect ids systems to be effective at detecting basic sql injection attack attempts e.g where someone is poking at your server in a simple way  i would not expect them to be effective at detecting sophisticated sql injection attacks  it is possible to build sql injection exploits that evade detection by idss     credentials obtained  this is too broad i don t know what path for obtaining credentials you had in mind so i don t know how to answer it  if you are talking about attackers trying to get access to a web application by guessing usernames and passwords i would not expect a network-based ids to detect those attacks     installation of ssh  i don t know whether idss detect installation of ssh  i m not clear on how they would distinguish an attacker who maliciously turns on a ssh server vs a sysadmin who turns on a ssh server for legitimate purposes  this seems like something you could test yourself easily     remote shell  i would not expect an ids to be effective at detecting most remote shells  perhaps sometimes but once the attacker has the ability to run code on your machine it is too easy for them to craft their own custom method for remote access that an ids won t detect  it is possible that some common cases can be detected i don t know and don t have enough experience to know     other anomalous behavior  to the best of my knowledge current network-based idss usually don t try to detect anomalies in general  rather it is more typical to have a signature of specific attack methods that have been observed in the wild  in other words they try to detect known attacks rather than unknown ones  detecting anomalies is quite challenging and usually leads to many false positives  for instance if you suddenly start seeing a lot more traffic somewhere how do you distinguish the case where you just got slashdotted and this is legitimate traffic from the case where you ve had a security breach and this is illegitimate traffic?  in the general case it can get pretty tricky    there s one more you didn t mention but which i think is important    configuration errors   configuration mistakes are one significant source of security problems  examples include running an old piece of software with a known vulnerability and failing to update it or inadvertently opening a hole in the firewall that exposed a vulnerable service  this is the sort of mistake that an ids can really help with by detecting attempts to exploit the vulnerable/misconfigured application   additionally after a security breach occurs an ids may make it easier to conduct a forensic examination of the damage done if it keeps good logs   information shown in alerts  the last question you asked has to do with what information is shown in the alert  that s a different question from whether the ids can detect the attack in the first place  i would guess that most users of idss are not in a position to usefully interpret all the technical details of an exploit so for most users showing those kinds of details might not be so useful  as far as what information is shown to the user in an alert that s a user interface question that is going to be dependent upon the specific product so if this is something that is important to you i suggest that you ask for a trial of the products you are considering and evaluate this aspect   targeted attacks  a quick note very little of the information above is specific to targeted attacks against your particular company or against a particular machine at your company  the answers for non-targeted attacks are roughly the same though it is possible an ids might be somewhat more effective for non-targeted attacks than for targeted attacks   how useful is an ids?  i don t know if you re going to find an authoritative answer to this question  it is pretty subjective  personally i think it is not clear how useful an ids is and my impression is that idss are often overhyped  my feeling is that ids s tend to be best at two things 1 detecting some common low-sophistication attacks 2 detecting breaches caused by configuration errors  i don t recommend idss as the primary means of defending your systems  however there is a plausible argument idss might have some value as a secondary defense e.g to catch inadvertent configuration errors that open up some hole that your other defenses didn t stop  whether the ids makes sense for you is something you ll have to judge for yourself but generally speaking an ids isn t one of the first few things i d prioritize if i were creating a security program from scratch   why use an ids?  your reaction at this point might be wait if idss are not so useful why does anyone use them?  i think one major factor is an ids is easy to deploy  you just plug the thing into your network and you re ready to go  you don t have to push software to your end users you don t have to update firewall policies and you don t have to deploy security restrictions that might block legitimate traffic  it feels like a no-pain solution to the security headache  a possible secondary reason for deployment of idss/ipss is compliance and checklists  if you have an ids you can check it off with your auditor and if there s a security breach you ll have some cya protection with your corporate executives well we deployed a state-of-the-art ids we did everything we could have  this exploits the fact that a non-technical audience is likely to assume that an intrusion prevention system is something that will reliably prevent intrusions  a third possible reason is idss produce reports lots of reports with graphs and pretty charts  managers likes reports it helps them feel like they can manage security and get a feeling for how they are doing  also sometimes security teams like these reports too they can be helpful in arguing to upper management why the company really needs to invest in security defenses we

20951,sse,0,0.47053352,antivirus|malware|virus,why would a virus writer bother to check to see if a machine is infected before infecting it,i was looking at the tripartite structure of a virus and it seems to check to see if a computer is infected before infecting it with the virus would this be an attempt to use files that are already present to infect instead of transferring another copy of the virus onto the machine,the goal of most malware is to remain active as long as possible the longer it can collect keystrokes participate in ddos attacks redirect search results send spam emails shows popup ads etc the more profitable it is for the creator to reach this goal it has to be undetected  if a piece of malware infects a machine twice it may leave the machine in an undefined state or cause conflicts it may also eat up more resources than normal this can lead to detection through a variety of operations   attempting to lock the same file twice causing a crash  injecting into running processes twice causing memory corruption and crashes  infecting the same file twice causing it to be corrupted  attempting to install multiple hooks on the same apis / objects / system messages causing erratic or undefined behaviour  increased cpu network and disk usage from the burden of having multiple copies installed   the less resources used and the less disturbance caused the less likely the user is to notice something is wrong once a user notices something isn t working properly they ll try to fix it which might result in the malware being removed as such it s better for the malware creator to prevent these problems and remain covert  it s partially a business reason rather than a technical reason i was once reading a blog post that was detailing a sales pitch and it was heavily stressed by the person selling access to infected machines for the purposes of spam relaying stealing credit card info ddos etc that he wouldn t load multiple binaries onto each bot  the more individual infections a machine has the more likely it is to be noticed by the user and the more likely it ll be cleaned it pays to fly under the radar  i would add as well in addition to other answers that there can be more than just checking to see if  i  am infecting the machine twice  i would if in that field check to make sure the machine isn t infected with other stuff as well as my stuff  the more stuff that s installed the more likely the machine will crash run slow or something will cause notice to the owner  preemptive removal of competitors products as well as verification of no prior version of my product would help keep the system mine as mentioned the goal would be to keep the cpu mine that means lay low and don t attract notice  the machine may become slow to the point where it s unusable for example if a virus continually sends out e-mails other programs would run slower and the network would become saturated and the internet would slow down if the virus is a file infector it would corrupt a file by infecting it too many times  the  first internet worm  back in 1988 killed off the internet for a little while only of course because it did not check properly for its presence before installing itself again it included a heuristic method which did not work as the author believed it would all the copies clogged the networks and choked the machines which was hardly inconspicuous  a virus will want to check for its presence before infecting for the same reasons to avoid drowning its host under multiple copies of itself to spread efficiently the virus must not kill its host too fast and the same applies to biological viruses by the way  there is nonetheless a subtlety there are a few simplistic viruses who damage the files they infect by writing themselves over whatever instructions were at that emplacement such a virus could write and rewrite itself over the same file with no additional ill effect however since the original file is damaged it does not work properly anymore which makes the virus less invisible and may prompt the user to do some cleaning therefore efficient viruses  copy  the instructions around in the infected files so that they get executed anyway the infected file is necessarily  enlarged  in the process if the virus infects a file repeatedly then the file might grow without any limit finally filling up the hard disk in true 1988 fashion,goal malwar remain activ long possibl longer collect keystrok particip ddo attack redirect search result send spam email show popup ads etc profit creator reach goal undetect

12428,sse,11,0.626257241,appsec|automated-testing|code-review|java,how to rate open source libraries,is there some kind of automated scanning tool which detects threats in open source java libraries?  i think the owasp orizon project tried to build such a tool but it seems to be inactive for years now  my goal is to find a metric which could act as a guide for the decision is it safe to use library x in my project.,you can restrict what java software may do by creating a security policy with the policy tool and setting that as the policy for the java virtual machine this is the security mechanism used for java applets  you did say open source that implies that you have the java code in hand so you can go further by creating automated tests for java software using a framework such as junit plus a considerable amount of coding by hand you can get a certain amount of automated coding for your tests out of tools like quickcheck finally you can use a tool like cobertura to check that all lines and branches of the code are exercised by the tests  if that testing succeeds within your security policy then you have verified that the software never strays from your restrictions you may still not want to take off the restrictions of your security policy short of actually reading the code for example if you have not succeeded to test 100% of the branches of the software which is often hard to do there is still the possibility that the software is detecting your security policy junit or cobertura and restraining its behavior accordingly   malicious logic and backdoors  you re not likely to find an automated tool to automatically detect things like backdoors malicious logic timebombs etc  these are too hard to detect with current techniques it is too easy to hide a backdoor that current analysis techniques are not likely to find  this is true of both static analysis and dynamic analysis.  moreover these kinds of backdoors are very rare -- probably not common enough to justify significant investment into building such a tool  i think you should be worried more about vulnerabilities and bugs than about maliciously placed backdoors  they re a lot more common  and if you are in a security-critical setting where you think there is a significant threat that a third party might try to deliberately insert a backdoor into a particular piece of code you are using well you shouldn t use that piece of code unless you trust the supplier  today the most effective development-time defenses against malicious backdoors and timebombs are as follows     vet the developers  choose developers who you trust  normally you ll want them to be your own employees  if you use external suppliers you ll need to vet them carefully     mandatory code review  all code should be reviewed by a second person other than the developer  the software development workflow and repository should be designed to track and enforce this policy  this provides two-person control no one person can introduce code that isn t reviewed and thus if everyone is taking the code review requirements seriously this process should make it harder for a single individual to introduce a backdoor without being detected  see also  how to review code for backdoors?  for related discussion     secure software repository  lock down the source code repository and build processes to ensure that no single insider can introduce malicious code into the binary    however these techniques remain limited in their effectiveness  i think you should also look at other defenses such as risk transfer isolation and sandboxing and monitoring  i elaborate on this elsewhere on this site    bugs and vulnerabilities  i would suggest that for most purposes you should be more concerned about bugs and vulnerabilities inadvertently introduced by a well-intentioned but fallible developers  there are many commercial and open source tools for scanning source code to detect bugs and vulnerabilities  for commercial tools see the trade press check out e.g fortify ibm appscan veracode and their competitors  the commercial tools are generally better than the open source tools  if you are using a third-party open source library i would also suggest that you check the cve vulnerability database for past and open reports of vulnerabilities  look to see how many vulnerabilities have been reported how rapidly they were reported and whether the project has technical details on the nature of the vulnerability  this should give you an idea of the project s security stance  if you want a more in-depth look you could look at  the coverity scan database  to see if they have scanned the library  you could also look through the library s bug tracker to see how they have handled security issues in the past  you could check to see if they have a clearly indicated security bug reporting process or place to report security bugs  these will give you a sense of the maturity of the project s software development process and its attitude towards security  you may also find the following industry white paper of interest  the unfortunate reality of insecure libraries    open source   your question seems to suggest you may be thinking that backdoors and timebombs are a greater threat in open source code than in closed source code  while that could be true i m not aware of any evidence for that assertion  if you re worried about backdoors and timebombs you should probably be worried about it in all the code you are using open source or closed source  another open source repository for security and defect info i ve found is the one from  coverity  but there are a lot of open source libraries used in the various linux distribution and quite a few libraries used in development  a blacklist of insecure open source components would be greatly appreciated but i was unable to find one,malici logic backdoor like find autom tool automat detect thing backdoor malici logic timebomb etc hard detect current techniqu easi hide backdoor current analysi techniqu like find true static analysi dynam analysis. moreov kind backdoor rare -- probabl common enough justifi signific invest build tool think worri vulner bug malici place backdoor lot common security-crit set think signific threat third parti might try deliber insert backdoor particular piec code use well piec code unless trust supplier today effect development-tim defens malici backdoor timebomb follow vet develop choos develop trust normal want employe extern supplier need vet care mandatori code review code review second person develop softwar develop workflow repositori design track enforc polici provid two-person control one person introduc code review thu everyon take code review requir serious process make harder singl individu introduc backdoor without detect see also review code backdoors?

there are other forms of malware which can be concealed within files using similar techniques so    executables most executable files are relatively sparse - there are big gaps between the legitimate code and data for various reasons can be for performance reasons or to take advantage of compiler optimisations or just because various compiler flags weren t set to squeeze the output size to the minimum some viruses take advantage of this and insert their instructions in these gaps which changes the resulting hash of the file note that a different hash means the contents are different not just that the file size has changed by hijacking the program entry point to execute the virus code before or instead of the legitimate code a virus can be executed when the application is started  note that in this case executable files include things like dll files - they are essentially windows executables which expose functions rather than being self contained applications there are some technical differences but in terms of infection they are pretty much identical - just hijack a call and make it point to your code rather than the original  linux executables are very similar in having empty space but the file system may also attempt to enforce rules as to whether specific files are treated as executables or data which can slightly complicated the issue    data files some data files especially media files images sounds videos use a block structure where a number of distinct types of data are stored in distinct blocks for example a png file is comprised of at minimum three chunks a header the image data and an end of file marker in these files it s often possible to add extra blocks using the correct form and add arbitrary data in a png file this could be adding an itxt chunk which is just a block of unicode text  however data files generally can t execute themselves so there will normally be either a modified executable file as well or a targeted flaw in a processing application for example if there was a command line image processing tool which took a folder of images and processed them in some way it might be that a flaw could be found that meant by providing a specific input file it added data to all files in the folder processed after the evil file making them behave in the same way this could be classified as virus-like behaviour but wouldn t meet some definitions of a computer virus  for some file types it s valid to add data after the legitimate file content too for example jpeg files can still work if you simply append text files to them - exactly as your mental image this could be  used  by a virus but due to the the lack of executability is unlikely to be the only part of a virus    other forms of malware make use of similar techniques there are whole families of malware which are inserted into php files and then execute when someone accesses the related page ransomware is often distributed by hijacking javascript files and adding malicious code to them in these cases though the code isn t usually self-replicating so doesn t meet all the technical details of being a virus,depend viru type file also bear mind viru technic describ self-repl form malwar -

for example   all-users frontend  http://www.example.website   admins-only backend  http://www.example.management    users are using first link only they may even not be aware of the fact that the other domain exists as it can be further secured on server side to disallow all traffic from outsite company network plus you don t have access to even a piece of management tools if you login through first domain you have access to your account s control panel only but never to anything related to entire website management  for obvious reasons both websites would use the same database i don t take replication as an option here -- see end of text and both top-level domains would most likely be parked on the same server / hosting low cost project -- see end of text but with a complete separation of each other  this is proposed as contrary to standard websites with rbac system implemented where -- if admin-level user logs in he or she gains access not only to his or her account control panel but also to entire website management tools system toys etc all based on determining his or her access rights   would implementation of separation of frontend and backend increase website security in any noticeable or reasonable way? or would that be just a waste of time money and resources?   one of my colleges claims that nowadays intruders doesn t care for something like breaking into account or control panel or gaining someone s password nowadays intrusions are based on ddos attacks  and physically killing server if that is true then my proposed solution  brings nothing an effective attack would put down entire server with both frontend and backend no matter how many domains it uses   btw we re talking about low-class website with up to 10k-100k users a home-grown project that turned out to become a bit more interesting hosted on one server without multi-server hosting without database replication without ddos attack mittigation etc we re not talking about another facebook or this class service as in this case they most likely have much much better solutions than multi-domain,putting the admin interface on a different domain is pure security-by-obscurity it doesn t matter how obscure you make the url as long as it can be reached from the public internet you have to take the possibility into account that it will one day become public knowledge  but even when you assume that sbo could be an advantage for you registering another domain just for your admin console might be counter-productive for maximum obscurity keep in mind that domain-registrations are public someone might accidently find that the domain example.management is registred and that the domain owner is you which could attract their attention but an admin interface placed on an obscure url on the domain itself leaves no public record of its existence anywhere as long as the server is configured properly  bottom-line don t try to hide your admin interface you should rather invest that energy into developing it in a secure way so that even when the whole world tries to access it they won t be successful     one of my colleges claims that nowadays intruders doesn t care for  something like breaking into account or control panel or gaining  someone s password nowadays intrusions are based on ddos attacks and  physically killing server   that s incorrect there were lots of break-ins into high-profile service with the intention to obtain users email addresses and passwords lately one can only guess how many such breaches occur daily but are never detected or reported to the public however a vulnerable admin interface is only one of many potential attack vectors which can lead to a data breach for information about the most common mistakes which lead to website vulnerabilities consult  the owasp top ten list   a denial-of-service dos attack is a way to cause some trouble to a website owner but it does not physically kill a server it only makes the server hard to reach while the attack takes place but causes no lasting damage and most importantly does not compromise any data on your server they are frequently performed because they require next to no technical expertise to perform but they are far from a serious security threat     would implementation of separation of frontend and backend increase website security in any noticeable or reasonable way?

my database   is there any security advantage to be gained by character-shifting the password before encrypting?  i.e        is there any security advantage to be gained by character-shifting the  hash  after encrypting excluding the  ? i.e    if there s no advantage to be gained is there any  loss  of security by doing this?  or is it a wash?   in light of the rise in  attacks based on standard password patterns  does obscuring these patterns help at all,no  the whole principle of modern cryptography is that you should  automatically assume  that the attacker knows your crypto scheme you re treating your scheme as secret which is a bad idea  stick to normal bcrypt / pbkdf2  applying a transform on passwords before hashing them makes no direct harm to security as long as it is  injective  two distinct passwords before apply the transform shall still be distinct once both are transformed your character shifting is fine for that if you do it properly i.e beware of transforming a byte of value 255 into a byte of value 0 which will truncate the password   indirectly  there is a bit of harm in that your extra transform is extra code thus extra complexity and complexity is always bad for security moreover if the transform is computationally expensive then it comes at odds with the iteration count used in pbkdf2/bcrypt i.e you have less cpu available so you must use a lower iteration count  a transform like the one you envision makes any good to the security only insofar as the attacker is not aware of it i.e the attacker did not do his homework basic low-power attackers who just got lucky with a sql injection attack may indeed lack the knowledge but these attackers are not the scary ones your extra transform will not deter strong attackers and that s strong attackers you should worry about  transforms applied  after  hashing have no influence whatsoever on security except if you are using something like extra hashing in which case you are just trying to build a custom hash function which as usual is a bad idea so don t do it the proper way to use your cpu is not to waste it on voodoo character shifts and other rituals instead use your cpu to have a bcrypt/pbkdf2 iteration count as high as is tolerable for your overall application performance  salting passwords does obscure these patterns you basically suggest salting two times once with your homemade salt and afterwards within bcrypt  this would only produce additional security in a scenario where you attaker doesn t know your homemade salt but does know the unique salt that you use with bcrypt   such a scenario shouldn t happen the attacker should only know your unique salt for bcrypt if he has access to your whole system and then he also knows your homemade salt   in general it s best practice to trust the encryption function instead of trying to implement your own one in this case it means trusting bcrypt to salt properly instead of trying to get salting right yourself   what you are doing with shifting the characters is adding a secret to the hashing process an attacker has to know or has to find out what you did before you calculated the hash otherwise he cannot use a dictionary to find the original password  there are better ways to add such a server-side secret you can encrypt the already hashed password with a block cypher two-way encryption to get your key an attacker not only needs read access to your database sql-injection additionally he must gain privileges on the server to read the key  EEEEEEEEEE½ with encrypting the password-hash you can prevent dictionary attacks as long as the key remains secret the key remains secret as long as the attacker has no privileges on the server  this is the same advantage a pepper can give you but in contrast to the pepper encrypting the hash allows to exchange the key should this be necessary  remember that clever brute force + dictionary attacks rely on being able to try millions of guesses a second properly implemented bcrypt / pbkdf2 / scrypt will require several tenths of a second per guess thus making brute force impractical on a large scale  the ars technica article makes it clear in

could there be some sort of spoofing going on or could someone be manipulating a norton tool on their machine to tell norton safe web that our site has malicious files?  we host our own website on our in-house web server and have properly configured firewalls up to layer 7 mcafee scans our site every day for vulnerabilities and has found no such files and google transparency report does not report anything malicious  none of the reported threatening links exist or to my knowledge have ever existed on our website we stopped using php a long time ago and yet safe web reports them on our website  i ve included the threat report below i ve only replaced my website with mywebsite and removed the http and www so it would not post as a link      drive-by downloads threats found 5          threat name web attack wordpress arbitrary file download 4 location:  mywebsite.com/wp-content/themes/theloft/download.php?file=../../../wp-config.php      threat name web attack wordpress arbitrary file download 4 location:  mywebsite.com/wp-content/plugins/history-collection/download.php?var=../../../wp-config.php      threat name web attack wordpress arbitrary file download 4 location:  mywebsite.com/wp-content/plugins/google-mp3-audio-player/direct_download.php?file=../../../wp-config.php      threat name web attack joomla component local file inclusion  location:  mywebsite.com/news/index.php?option=com_macgallery&amp;view=download&amp;albumid=../../web.config.txt      threat name web attack wordpress arbitrary file download 4 location:  mywebsite.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&amp;img=../wp-config.php       viruses threats found 1         threat name web attack joomla component local file inclusion  location:  mywebsite.com/news/index.php?option=com_macgallery&amp;view=download&amp;albumid=././web.config.txt   notice they are all php and mention wordpress and joomla none of which we have nor use  we are in the process of disputing the report with norton but this is the second time that this has happened and the dispute process is taking quite a while meanwhile people are being told that our website is not safe and we are losing customers i know there is nothing more i can do to speed up the process with norton but i would like to understand how this is even possible and i would like to be able to prevent this type of thing reoccurring in the future   so in summary  what i m trying to understand is is it possible for norton safe web to have been tricked into giving a false report of our site or is the only possibility that someone put a file on our site in time for norton to scan then took it off before we found it?  i ll greatly appreciate any input.thanks,this is a norton security/safeweb false positive their threat scanning engine is flawed when handling reponses from these  hacked  urls which in vulnerable systems can do damage the problem is that they interpret the response incorrectly so sites that have no php/wordpress etc get flagged in error  this is hugely damaging to customer goodwill of course and they do not make it easy or fast to dispute additionally they do not notify the domain holder in our experience at least so often the first to report is from a customer in our case it was a prospective customer who first reported the problem they did not buy a website from from us due to this false warning and the delay in getting it resolved  it is not your site per se but rather the response that the site returns to what is essentially a bad uri if they get anything other than a hard 404 response they take that to mean the url is valid and therefore a vulnerability  my guess is that your firewall returned a 301 redirect to the initial request which showsredirects to the file not found page  this is called a soft 404 a common way to download a file is via a 301 redirect so this raises a red flag to the scanner  you need to make sure the actual response is a hard 404 in these cases if not the norton threat scanner assumes the url found the vulnerable file/page and you get flagged,norton security/safeweb fals posit threat scan engin flaw handl repons hack url vulner system damag problem interpret respons incorrectli site php/wordpress etc get flag error huge damag custom goodwil cours make easi fast disput addit notifi domain holder experi least often first report custom case prospect custom first report problem buy websit us due fals warn delay get resolv site per se rather respons site return essenti bad uri get anyth hard 404 respons take mean url valid therefor vulner guess firewal return 301 redirect initi request showsredirect file found page call soft 404 common way download file via 301 redirect rais red flag scanner need make sure actual respons hard 404 case norton threat scanner assum url found vulner file/pag get flag,,virus|flaws|attacks|spoofing|vulnerability|malicious file,6,15,698,0.021489971,29/02/2016 22:57,DC,Doesn't understand why site being flagged as malicious. ,Ex,Explains why

 from my understanding this should be a easy one to detect.i guess the most basic thing to do is add this ip-address to some blacklist and just check the dns entry against the blacklist also figuring out how to read the systems dns entry shouldn t be that much of a deal for devs of such a company should it?  so what might be reasons for kaspersky not being able to track this except simply lumpyness of the corresponding dev?  note i m legit interested in this i m not trying to rant if this might appear so one can feel free to replace the product name with a pseudoproductname,when checking quickly i saw several instances of the exact opposite issue kaspersky blocking any connection to user s router s ip  the most probable explanation is that kaspersky actually blocks known malicious ips given that you use the right product ie at least kaspersky internet security and no the standalone anti-virus but with two main prerequisites   the malicious ips must be known it must have been confirmed as malicious by kaspersky teams added in a blacklist and your software must have updated this blacklist however chances are that the attacker will change the ips they use regularly  the malicious ip must indeed be malicious:  often this is just a shared or compromised host which is also serving legitimate contents completely blocking the ip could have unwanted side-effect to give a concrete example there are poor-quality blacklists on the internet which are regularly blocking major cdns like cloudfare because their ips have been used to serve some malware once such blacklist is applied it becomes impossible to access any website relying on cloudflare services..  or the malware is exploiting some legal grey area     following your comments in your case this seems to be this latter case  you seem to be affected by the dns unlocker software a company advertising on their website   url voluntary made not clickable a service allowing to bypass geo-restricted contents but proposing no download to actually install their software !  they explicitly explain that they achieve so by replacing the standard dns server by their own one which will replace the answers for filtered websites they show a clear terms and privacy statements provide detailed and complete uninstallation instruction including the fact that the dns configuration will have to be modified manually inform that their application is ad-supported and provide a contact form  they also seem related to greenteam   honest enough to announce in their about us page that they are located in israel and not the uk... formerly cloudguard as per my understanding which rely on the very same system to filter malicious websites Ã  la  opendns  then but with injected ads and content...  should an anti-virus block such kind of grey area services?

209504,sse,11,0.7228988409999999,integrity|virtualization|vulnerability,how secure is virtualization against breaking out of the box,how secure are all currently used virtualization technologies containers - bsd jail openvz hypervisors - hyper-v kvm etc?   i heard about one vulnerability in vmware software which lets you break out of the guest machine  what s the most secure option? i need this for malware analysis,first this is a pretty broad question since there are many virtualization technologies so please don t expect an in-depth comparison of each of these there are actually several resources on the internet which provide more detailed information like  security aspects of virtualization  from enisa a  simple google search  will provide even more resources thus this is mainly a summary without too much details which also only covers the main technologies  the main virtualization technologies are full virtualization like offered by kvm virtualbox vmware esxi hyper-v etc on the one side and container based virtualization like done in lxc openvz bsd jail etc on the other   full virtualization  in full virtualization the virtual machines share performance critical host hardware like cpu and ram with some hardware-assisted separation but emulates other hardware like network cards or display but there are technologies to share parts of such hardware too inside the guest vm there is a full os like windows or linux which does not need  to have special drivers to deal with the virtualization but there are usually special drivers anyway since these make it possible to have more performance like using hardware-assisted sharing of host resources and more flexibility like changing the amount of ram and cpu without rebooting the guest vm   the main attack path in full virtualization is this hardware emulation since it usually requires some kind of complex interaction between host and guest bugs in this separation allow the guest to break out the virtualization but usually an attacker running inside the guest vm has to break several security layers to be successful first he needs to find a problem in his execution environment use this to elevate privileges inside the guest vm use this to break out of the guest and then find and use an attack against the vm host   container based virtualization  container based virtualization is weaker but also provides more performance since the virtualized processes are just normal processes running inside the host os and using the host kernel the separation is done with namespaces i.e namespace for network for users for process ids etc this also means that you cannot run a completely different os inside a container i.e you cannot run windows inside a linux container like lxc etc you could though run for example redhat inside an lxc running on ubuntu since they both use the linux kernel  compared to the small hypervisor in full virtualization the container based virtualization is way more complex and provides a larger attack surface on the other hand there is no need for complex emulation of hardware either since guests use the same kernel as the host but a security issue inside the kernel would allow an attacker inside the guest to take over the host while with full virtualization it would only allow the attacker to take over the guest vm  summmary  full virtualization provides more security than container based virtualization additionally container based virtualization is restricted it what you can do specifically you are not able to run a different os thus it might not be a usable platform for malware analysis in the first place  but if you could do your analysis either inside a container or inside a vm you could actually combine both to provide even more

60815,sse,11,0.772023737,metrics|risk-analysis|risk-management|secure-coding,security metrics on softwares developed,thinking about software security metrics currently i ve thought about the following software security metrics   number/type of cwe detected by developers bug reporting  number/type of cwe detected by static analysis  number/type of warning at compile time i.e from stack protector / fortify source    number/type of presumed memory leaks running software under valgrind or whatever  number/type of unsafe function calls sprintf instead of snprintf   now the questions   what other security metrics on software do you suggest ?    is there a state-of-the art reference on this topic ?    i was able to found only security metrics on it but not on softwares software development   the goals is to measure and have an overview on how bad/good are the softwares developed and measure where increase/decrease effort on secure software development practices or how/where security process needs some changes,"andy ozment has proposed an interesting security metric for software in his paper  bug auctions vulnerability markets reconsidered weis 2004  roughly speaking his idea is that a software vendor sets a prize for the next vulnerability to be found the prize starts from a fixed amount e.g 100$ and grows every day e.g 10$/day when a vulnerability hunter white/black hat found a new vulnerability he is awarded the current amount of money and the prize is set back to the initial amount and grows again now after a while the software vendor can use  the current prize as the security metric for his software  so if the prize now is 10000$ it means that even under such incentive hunters still cannot find a new vulnerability and thus the software is pretty secure there are some economical analysis in the paper to show advantages and disadvantages of this idea  the paper also has some citations related to software security metrics that might be helpful to you they might be old though  thanks  say all the metrics you listed in your question report zero  does that mean your software is secure?  does finding 0 bugs mean there are no bugs?    the reason you re having a hard time finding software-only metrics is because software doesn t exist in a vacuum  here s a  question that s just as difficult  how much is a piece of software  worth?     there are several questions i d ask if someone just handed me a report with the metrics you listed here    what security policies are your metrics being weighed against?  as much as i despise the topic boooooring!!!! security in any organization--and therefore its software--need to be based on sound security policy  and concentrating on software alone as you want to do in your question is sidestepping a piece it shouldn t be sidestepping  and please note that policies can determine how severe certain bugs are in comparison to each other  that said   owasp  has a presentation  here  that may interest you   warnings from the presentation: software security metrics    metrics are context sensitive and environment-dependent  architecture dependent  aggregation may not lead to strength   here are a few metrics they list   size and complexity  weakness/loc cwe  weakness severity,type over time cvssv2 cwe  cost per defect  attack surface # of interfaces   layers of security  design flaws cwe   and  this paper  while not a one stop reference  does  present a method of weighting specific kinds of security flaws which could be used to develop a scoring system that you can apply to developers/applications    and lastly a very important statistic that i think you should consider are the number of false positives both by testing tools and by human testers    and then there s  cvss","say metric list question report zero mean softwar secure?

 is it safe to assume that no open ports means no remote access?  excluding the possibility that there is a badware already on the machine that makes outgoing connections to send/receive data/instructions  edit looks like we also would have to disable icmp to help prevent denial of service type attacks and the possibility of buffer overflow or other undiscovered attacks also the possibility that the server would receive a spoofed ping that then sends the response to a third party victim for denial of service   edit looks like one should also look at  good -ware that makes outgoing connections to send/receive data/instructions such as dns the dns server instructs the unix machine what other machines to connect to and send/receive data for one has to make sure that the dns server is not hacked and the routers on the way are not hacked  edit i am specifically referring to network attacks in this question as far as client-side attacks cookies social engineering xss etc. that is not for this question   edit  i am attempting to hopefully fully secure the servers so that they theoretically will not need a firewall firewalls are intended but not part of this question     related  what security risks does ip spoofing bring,it is absolutely not safe  here is a simple example a user of the machine browses the web visits sketchy web sites and clicks on various links  this can easily cause the security of the machine to be compromised e.g by drive-by downloads or by social engineering to fool the user into installing malware  this is true even if the os does not have any open ports it is listening on  regardless of whether this should apply specifically to unix i would say that it is  not  safe to assume no access just because there are no open ports    to wit  icmp  is usually listened to even if no tcp or udp ports are available and before you say but icmp is just a simple  ping ! it s irrelevant to attack using that! check these out    ping of death     smurf attack    and of course  ping flood     and while these are all pretty much historical with the exception of the last i wouldn t rule out additional future attacks     in addition there are the indirect attacks such as those that attack the infrastructure that the closed-off system would itself access - e.g dns poisoning..    if you can ensure that your network hardware has no open ports for any protocol then it will not be able to receive packets - this will make it very unlikely to be attacked through the network however if you were wanting all ports closed i would advise unplugging the network cable because i can think of a potential issue   you could have a rootkit which reports closed ports when in actuality there is one open      what type of attacks are there that do not use open tcp or open udp ports?   this is way too general of a question i m answering this very literally not to be a jerk but because in security it s best to assume nothing  here are some classes of attacks that do not use open tcp or udp ports   social engineering get someone to connect outbound from the machine to an attack site or attach a thumb drive or bad media  physical access keyloggers etc  an attack at the ip level ip stack vulnerabilities  ntp usually turned on by default and might not be bug-free  dhcp  is dhcp turned off?  an attacker on the local net could push a pxe boot image to your ethernet card and load their os      is it safe to assume that no open ports means no remote access?    drive-by downloads that get executed could call out including pinging out bound and getting ctrl data via ping reply  package managers could pull down trojaned software setting up call-out malware  bluetooth access   i think your real question should be  what kinds of remote exploits can be used to root my machine if it has no open tcp or udp ports?     attacks  can mean any number of things to people including van eck phreaking    if one permits dns then one permits  ip over dns   the fundamental problem of these classes of attacks is not within tcp or udp protocols themselves it is with the requirement of applications to process data from an untrusted or less trusted source and faulty design and/or qa within said applications  if your server is running any applications which process input from a source which does not have the same level of trust as your server and you do not have a strong qa process in place for said applications you are vulnerable  for example though several buffer overflows have presented themselves via pre-authentication communications with applications that happen to listen on tcp and udp ports they can just as easily be presented in routines that read data from a network resource that does not involve a listening connection or even in functions that read from local resources such as files and databases in many of these cases the programmer does not have the hostile mindset to the data that they do with socket programming  it is my experience that this is where the low-hanging fruit is found  in my opinion you are looking for a unicorn and the only way you will end up with your current desired result is by leaving your server in a clean and locked room with no network connection at all  the primary goal of a server is functionality not security and compromises must be made with regards to untrusted input  the way to mitigate this risk while still delivering functionality is to enable only the functionality needed and to compensate for the required services by qa/audit processes such as code review and penetration testing operational processes such as monitoring and incident response and infrastructure to prevent or detect undesired input and connectivity  even if your operating system is completely secure your hardware may be vulnerable many network cards respond to various remote administration protocols  wake-on-lan   alert-on-lan   asf  EEEEE¦  in practice an actual vu,regardless whether appli specif unix would say safe assum access open port wit icmp usual listen even tcp udp port avail say icmp simpl ping ! irrelev attack use that! check ping death smurf attack cours ping flood pretti much histor except last rule addit futur attack addit indirect attack attack infrastructur closed-off system would access - e.g dns poisoning.,en.wikipedia.org,cve|poison|trojan|attacks|malware|exploit|ip spoofing|vulnerability|buffer overflow|untrusted inputs|penetration test|denial of service|cross site scripting,13,42,1142,0.036777582999999996,27/12/2010 19:10,DH,Wants to know if its possible for an attack to not listen for open sockets,"DC, ES",States that it is not safe to assume no ports = no attack and provides examples as to why. 
123136,sse,6,0.505592108,certificates|tls,why is the sha-1 hash of certificate sent in tls client certificate url extension,according to  rfc6066  constrained clients can send certificate urls instead of full certificates for tls client authentication   an active attacker can easily modify the url to point to a certificate or certificate chain of their choice &amp replace the 20 bytes of sha1hash with the corresponding computed sha1 hash and the server will realize the problem only when it tries to verify the certificate verify message from the client also the server verifies the sha1 hash only after fetching the contents pointed by the url so any generic attack like buffer overflow or sql injection on the server hosting the url is also not prevented then why is 20-byte sha1 hash of url included with this message,from my understanding your problem is that an active man in the middle can make a server s access a url at host u and this url is specified by the attacker and the problem with this is not that the attacker might get to the contents behind this url he can t but that just accessing this url might trigger a bug at the server u  thus to make this attack working the following conditions must apply   there must be a bug in server u which can be triggered just by accessing the specific url   the attacker can do an active man in the middle attack  the attacker is either not willing or not able to access server u directly so it needs to use server s to access this url  server s does implement the feature to get the clients certificate from a url   server s does no filtering which kind of url s it can access or server u is allowed by this filter   if all this applies it can be used to attack server u but in most cases there are far easier ways to make somebody access url like accessing the url directly including it in some   tag at some web site to be accessed by somebody else or similar     then why is 20-byte sha1 hash of url included with this message?   while i do not find any explicit explanation in the rfc my guess is that it is only to make sure that the server u actually provided the expected content and not something else which makes a bit sense in cases where the client itself has no real control over changes done at server u this is not to prohibit attacks against server u   of course if the content served by u does not contain the expected client certificate it will be noticed during the handshake anyway because the private key used by the client does not match the client certificate thus it is questionable if this hash is really helpful or if it is just another useless feature which nevertheless made in in the standard remember the tls heartbeat extension where the server for no real reason had to send the contents of the clients request payload back,understand problem activ man middl make server access url host u url specifi attack problem attack might get content behind url access url might trigger bug server u thu make attack work follow condit must appli must bug server u trigger access specif url attack activ man middl attack attack either will abl access server u directli need server access url server implement featur get client certif url server filter kind url access server u allow filter appli use attack server u case far easier way make somebodi access url access url directli includ tag web site access somebodi els similar 20-byte sha1 hash url includ message? find explicit explan rfc guess make sure server u actual provid expect content someth els make bit sens case client real control chang done server u prohibit attack server u cours content serv u contain expect client certif notic handshak anyway privat key use client match client certif thu question hash realli help anoth useless featur nevertheless made standard rememb tls heartbeat extens server real reason send content client request payload back,,attacks|sql injection|buffer overflow|man in the middle,4,14,509,0.027504912000000003,12/5/2016 21:15,Co,Wants to know why SHA-1 certificate hashes are sent in extensions,Ex,Gives an explanations of the concepts and why it is secure

103408,sse,11,0.36952367399999997,attack-prevention|authentication|dictionary|user-names,what is the risk of different responses when a login username matches or not,i am responsible for a website that allows a user to reset the password as usual however the response of the website is different whether the entered username matches or not  this would allow an attacker to derive a dictionary of usernames in use   is this considered a risk? how much?   notes   the website logs each request so after a while repeated requests will pile up but there are no other measures currently  i will soon fix that problem by returning the same response content but would like to use this behaviour as an exercise to me and learn about security i could imagine that by response-time-measurements the fix will still allow to at least guess usernames  before fixing i would like to see how bad or not this specific problem is after the fix i would like to rerun any previously successful test to assert that the problem really is gone   using the zap proxy and sqlmap with aggressive levels i was not able to find an automated exploit/test to this problem,it is good practice to just supply a simple username or password is invalid message if the user is performing a reset ask for their email address and send an email to that account stating it is not a valid email address or send the reset link if it is the less information you can expose directly on the site the better it is also a good idea to have the login name and name displayed and used on the site different   risks of acknowledging a username is correct or publicly displaying them  it makes it easy for someone to use a a bot or automated tool to scan your site for user names or test a list of known usernames to build a list of accounts which can then be brute-forced or if the user has a list of stolen usernames and passwords to attempt known passwords that may work if someone uses the same password on multiple sites with no way to confirm that the account is real they will not waste their time trying to compromise an account that is questionable if it actually exists if you confirm an account exists you have given a verified target   you give away information the result is that a bot can first try to find usernames and then for those specific usernames try to find passwords that makes it a lot easier to find good combinations   how much this is a risk depends on what other measures you ve taken do you limit login attempts? do you log ip addresses and monitor suspicious attempts? do you take action when you see this kind of activity? do you notify users and administrator? do you require strong passwords?   why do you need to test for this if you know how it works?      is this considered a risk? how much?   yes there is a certain risk because you are enhancing the  surface attack  leading to two scenarios   bruteforcing attack over an already known username of your website  password guessing attack suppose a user logs to your website with the username firstnamelastname an attacker could google that full name and lands on that user s personal website where he publishes pictures of his wife children his favorite food which thing is quite frequent the attacker could guess that user s password which are efficient especially that  most users use alphanumeric passwords most of the time          solution   instead of displaying an error message as you did  username already used  use just a  generic message error  such as   username or password incorrect    while it is true that displaying a different message whether or not the username exist might increase the surface attack you have to realize that generally    a username is not a secret    username are often public available to anyone that visit the websiteex forums   username are often email address public again   username are often reused between multiple sites public again   there is very few applications were the username is totally secret is it your case? is there no way for anyone else than the user to know his username? but let s look at the risks..   security risk   when we are talking about a username/password combo there is almost no security risk in revealing the username some people might argue that you could make yourself vulnerable to brute force attack but it won t work why? it s simply because brute force attacks do not work over a network as in most case you will create a denial of service attack before you are able to crack a single password   privacy risk   the one place where it might be critical to keep a username secret might be when the user do not wish to be associated with the service  but .. if the user really want to stay secret why doesn t he chooses a username that cannot be linked to him?

26226,sse,11,0.456538945,exploit|network|penetration-test,how was pentest performed in the era with no frameworks like metasploit,i have been interested in security lately i have been reading mainly cookbooks on metasploit framework how social engineering has been employed exhaustively i have started reading some ia-32 concepts but then i get confused at some point if i take into account an attack with no user interaction - no possibility of client-side attack -  no framework like metasploit available no nmap no nessus what and how does a pentest happen? what s in the core?  hypothetically speaking a friend of mine runs an amateurish webserver he coded full of flaws and vulnerability this server is running on port 80 i went his home i got a copy of the software with no permission and write out his network infos at home i scrutinized the code and i found a stack overflow vulnerability  but what s next? here i can barely concatenate.my exploit as a clientbrowser needs to connect to his webserver on port 80 in order to exploit the vulnerability and deploy the payloada reverse one? the latter is going to need to act as a server to connect back to my another client that is listening waiting for a shell? i am quite confused about naked pentest i feel there are misunderstandings i unfortunately made that i would like some explanations to fill in the gaps in order for me to move on besides that english is not my first language thanks in advance,the same way a capture the flag challenge happens  you craft everything yourself   in the end metasploit nessus and nmap are all tools or a collection of tools to perform some tasks more easily but you can easily write them yourself a basic port scanner is quite easy to write the thing is that nessus and metasploit reduce the time you have to spend as a pentester and the exploits are ready for use this means you do not need a lot of skill to apply the exploits   what you are trying to do requires some very deep understanding and i fear that we cannot explain you how to craft such an exploit in just a few steps i advice you to study this a bit further books like the  shellcoders handbook  are really good at explaining this but it s not for the faint hearted  before metasploit and other frameworks we used separate tools wrote our own tools or did things manually  port scanners and network service identifier tools have been around for a long time - almost as long as the field of computer security itself even if you didn t have access to nmap you could script up a simple port scanner in most languages within a couple of hours  a framework makes little difference as to how you would develop and use an exploit for a new vulnerability the only change when using a framework is that you have to make the exploit module compatible with that framework  first you would identify the buffer offset for controlling eip in a framework you might use a tool like   to generate a special data blob and then calculate the offset based on eip without such a tool you just have to use trial and error - make a blob of data that starts with a bunch of 0x41414141 values and switches to 0x42424242 values later on run the exploit check the stack then re-calculate your number of 0x41414141 values keep going until you find the right number of bytes before the eip offset from there you can control eip and set it up to run a rop chain to virtualprotect or just a   if dep is disabled your payload could be a reverse shell or whatever you want you would set up a script that listens on a tcp port for your incoming connection and pipe it through to stdin/stdout so you can interact with the shell  complicated but that s  still  how it s done today - we just take the results of that process and stick them into a metasploit module at the end   p.s for more info on exploit writing for native code on the windows platform i highly recommend checking out the  corelan exploit writing tutorials,metasploit framework use separ tool wrote tool thing manual port scanner network servic identifi tool around long time - almost long field comput secur even access nmap could script simpl port scanner languag within coupl hour framework make littl differ would develop exploit new vulner chang use framework make exploit modul compat framework first would identifi buffer offset control eip framework might tool gener special data blob calcul offset base eip without tool trial error - make blob data start bunch 0x41414141 valu switch 0x42424242 valu later run exploit check stack re-calcul number 0x41414141 valu keep go find right number byte eip offset control eip set run rop chain virtualprotect dep disabl payload could revers shell whatev want would set script listen tcp port incom connect pipe stdin/stdout interact shell complic still done today - take result process stick metasploit modul end p.s info exploit write nativ code window platform highli recommend check corelan exploit write tutori,www.corelan.be,flaws|exploit|pentest|attacks|protection|vulnerability|penetration test,7,24,714,0.033613445,30/12/2012 22:35,Co,Wants to know how pentests were performed before frameworks,"Ex, ES",Explains how it was done
118344,sse,11,0.304143339,denial-of-service,normal usage vs denial-of-service? how many requests are needed to talk about a denial of service,recently i used a tool to download a website and as part of the tool one could adjust the number of parallel connections so now i found myself asking starting from how many requests a provider could rate it as a denial of service i googled around however didn t find specific numbers or at least hints about what dimensions we are talking about is there any definition e.g like 100 requests a second?  so my question is how many requests are needed to state that a denial of service is in progress?   update  the technical background is definitely of interest i understand that  one  malicious packet could be enough to cause a denial of service or the slashdot effect is another but what i wanted to know was more of a firewall style rule some servers / service providers block out users which send too many requests in a certain time frame about what dimension are we talking about here? or is that too specific? if so what would your rule look like?  the question also had a legal component - let me illustrate a high! theoretical scenario  a provider of a service checks its logs and sees that there has been high traffic from a single ip now the provider goes to court for whatever reason and labels this as an attempted denial of service the judge would probably ask for their definition of a dos anything beyond the normal usage would be their answer so where is the threshold between normal usage and none normal usage which could be interpreted as an attempted dos even if the server remains totally unimpressed and this is probably a highly constructed scenario ;,"enough to cause the service to be denied to someone might be 1 unexpected malicious request which causes excessive load on the server might be several million expected requests from a tv advert with a really good response  there isn t a specific value since all servers will fail at different levels - serving static content is a lot easier on the server than generating highly customised content for each user so generally authenticated services will have a lower problem threshold than unauthenticated ones servers sending the same file to multiple users may be able to handle more traffic than servers sending distinct files to multiple users since they can hold the file in memory a server with a fast connection to the internet will usually be able to handle more traffic than one with a slow connection but the distinction might be less dependent on that if the generated traffic is cpu bound  i ve seen systems that fail at 3 requests per second i ve also seen systems which handle everything up to 30,000 requests per second without breaking a sweat what would be a dos to the first would be a low traffic period to the second..   updated to respond to update    how do firewall providers determine when traffic is causing a denial of service?   usually they watch for response times from the server and throttle traffic if they go above a pre-set limit this can be decided on a technical basis or on a marketing basis - waiting x seconds causes people to leave or if the server responses change from successful 200 to server failure 50x    what is a legal definition of denial of service?   same as the original one i gave - it s not denial of service if service has not been denied it might be abusive but that wouldn t be quite the same thing   to build on matthew s answer in respect to philip rowlands comment  the general rule of thumb for defining dos traffic is  context   if you just ran a tv ad at the superbowl you can assume the ensuing flood of traffic is contextually non-malicious whether it causes a service outage is irrelevant  where as if it s just another tuesday morning and your site it flooded with requests for no identifiable reason it would be safe to assume the traffic is malicious or at least suspicious eg unknown reddit post as opposed to a targeted attack  when you download or scrape a website you are basically sending a lot of get requests for each url in the target website   this is an example of get request from the world wide web consortium website     get /pub/www/theproject.html http/1.1      host www.w3.org   as you can see the main issue is not the request but the response of the webserver which sends you the whole resource identified by the given url  therefore we can say that     max number of requests per second = factor of safety * bandwidth/ max size of a webpage   judging from a quick google search the average size of a webpage is about 2 mb and the bandwidth of a web server can range from a few mbps to a few tbps  the factor of safety is related to the fact that in order to cause a dos attack you may not need to send a number of requests corresponding to the 100% of the bandwidth for example if the webserver has a 100 mbps bandwidth and 50% of it is used at a given instant for other users it is enough to send a number of requests corresponding to 50% or even a smaller percentage of the bandwidth  50% of 100 mbps = 50 mbps which corresponds to 25 average get requests per second  on the other hand if no one else is visiting the website you would need to use at least 80% of the bandwidth in order to cause a dos and 80% of 100 mbps = 80 mbps which corresponds to 40 get requests per second  clearly in order to unintentionally dos a huge website having a bandwidth of 1 tbps you would need to send at least 80% of 1 tbps/2 mbps =400,000 get requests per second and so on  in order to have a more accurate measurement you would need to find the maximum size of a webpage in the target website and its bandwidth   warning  since you could potentially get in trouble for causing a denial of service it is better to round down the number of request per second you obtain through the previous formula  i debated about making this an answer it might be better as a comment  lets take a look at your question from both angles    from the host   something becomes a dos when the about of traffic or what that traffic is doing causes the  server to be unavailable for others a few examples   running a long running report 500 times  smashing refresh really fast on a web site that can t handle it  using your larger bandwidth to fill their upload pipe so full others loose speed  scraping the website in a way that causes there host to be non-responsive to others    all these examples are possible but not likely when we talk about a dos attack we are talking about one person/client doing all this and most web servers are set to handle hundreds or thousands of requests at the same time that s why ddos is so popular because it takes more then one client to overload a normal server under normal circumstances   to add complication many clients may start using your site for the first time after some marketing sometimes it s not even your marketing that triggers it for example a popular cell phone release may cause a spike in traffic on your how to site it can be very difficult to tell ddos traffic from legit traffic   there are a few ground rules though what your basically looking for is abnormal usage   are there users that are downloading way more then others?  are there users that are staying connected way longer then others?  are there users that are re-connecting way more then others?   these guides and others can help you figure out what traffic is part of a ddos attack and apply some kind of filter    from the user s pov   when deciding to scrape a website you should check first and see if they have a policy some sites do and some do not some sites will consider it theft and others not if a site does not have a policy then you have to make your own call  your goal if they do not have a stated policy is to clearly stated that your scraping don t mask the user agent or header that your tool might be using and to try to have a little impact as possible depending on your need for scraping can you scrape just a few pages or do you really need the entire site? can you scrape at a normal user rate maybe 1 page every 5 seconds or so including media content? if you want to capture the data fast can you just capture the text files and not capture the images and other media? can you exclude long running queries and larger media files   you over all goal here it to be respectful of the hosts cost of hosting and the other users of the site slower is usually better in this case if possible contact the website owner and ask them and no matter what follow the rules in the robots.txt file it can have a rate limit and page limits that you should follow",debat make answer might better comment let take look question angl host someth becom dos traffic traffic caus server unavail other exampl run long run report 500 time smash refresh realli fast web site handl use larger bandwidth fill upload pipe full other loos speed scrape websit way caus host non-respons other exampl possibl like talk dos attack talk one person/cli web server set handl hundr thousand request time ddo popular take one client overload normal server normal circumst add complic mani client may start use site first time market sometim even market trigger exampl popular cell phone releas may caus spike traffic site difficult tell ddo traffic legit traffic ground rule though basic look abnorm usag user download way others?

   should i put mechanisms in place that simply block ips after a certain number of unsuccessful page requests within a certain amount of time?    is anyone familiar with this specific attack,it would probably pretty safe to say that this was an automated scan looking for known scripts with vulnerabilities in all honesty this has nothing to do with your ability to code but the laziness of script kiddies looking for flawed websites   an attacker will most likely have no idea what scripts frameworks apps and services are running on your server if you block certain header attributes in accordance with best practices they will need to guess by trying all known framework directory structures and key files like   and hoping for a   response from the http server if they get back a 200 they know that script is active and they can start narrowing down on known security flaws for example if they find   they can try remote inclusion to get your vars they can try to find   to backdoor or water hole your site etc   pretty much take what you learned from the attack and code against it don t name any of your files or routes with frequently scanned files and directories by staying below the water you can hopefully keep your code safe for just a little bit longer     is anyone familiar with this specific attack?  by looking at the requests i would venture to say that you were visited by a registration bot      what should i do with the information i got today?  yes there are ways that you can use this information to manage/protect your server but that is a much longer conversation and depends heavily on your network your security needs and your need to support clients/customers   sort of acting on the information e.g autoban/autoblock by ip et cetera you can at the very least monitor what is happening  this too is a long conversation and a myriad approaches that will depend upon the same major aspects network security &amp support mentioned above  if you are not already using some sort of  analytics  package across your website then i would say that would be the most useful and thing you could do- it would double as a reporting mechanism for your legitimate users as well as any unwelcome visitors  welcome to the wild wild interwebs   both the attacks you described seem pretty much automated scans done via some tool some tools can even throttle the requests to avoid detection by ids so that could be a reason for a slow request rate of the scan you mentioned this specific scan you mentioned appears to sniff for presence of a forum software on your website  e.g ucp.php is a phpbb forum file       i wonder what the hacker s goal was to try all these urls   the attacker s goal here is to identify the framework/scripting language/software running on this domain     what should i do with the information i got today?   well if you are curious to know more about the intentions behind these attacks you could search the ip address on google and check if there are any known instances of attacks from this ip  for example i just checked my server logs for such automated scanning in past 1 hour and i saw extensive scans from this ip   searching this on google immediately led me to  this report  and  this page  which detail more about this rouge ip and its activities so at least i can rest assured that this wasn t an targeted attack most are not  if you want to go a step further you could install software like  fail2ban  and configure it to automatically detect such scans and blacklist the ip address for a specified duration of time     is anyone familiar with this specific attack?   i am afraid you might see more of such scans as your site domain gets popular/old there are tonnes of scripts with various intentions some try to find comments/feedback pages where they can just post link spams others might be looking for some very specific vulnerability,welcom wild wild interweb attack describ seem pretti much autom scan done via tool tool even throttl request avoid detect ids could reason slow request rate scan mention specif scan mention appear sniff presenc forum softwar websit e.g ucp.php phpbb forum file wonder hacker goal try url attack goal identifi framework/script language/softwar run domain inform got today?

 the safer bet is to deploy anti-virus software as one of the many controls to help you play good defense    check out  http://www.av-test.org/certifications.php  to help you select an anti-virus solution  there are a few points to consider here    first av is not a fail-safe catch-all mechanism for any malware even ignoring the blurred line between antivirus and antimalware these engines function differently even if they are packaged in a single product there is no av/antimalware product that will catch customized targeted attack code so if that is the threat you are trying to protect against you can just as well forget that    secondly if you  are  accepting file uploads from users especially essentially anonymous users you  should  play it safe and go for defense in depth - even it s trivial to get around av you can at least block the low hanging fruit - and the innocent victims who continue to spread the payload unknowingly    third if you want to play it super-safe and have av even if you don t need it like @tate recommended you should realize that while you will be safer from viruses again low probability but still exists this is  not  free there are costs involved   using av  on  the server can add risk to the server since you re adding potentially vulnerable code - less code less attack surface there have even been cases of attacks on the server via the av interfaces  checking for viruses right there on your server isn t necessarily the safest option since these can potentially leak and fool the av also see  george ou over on zdnet  about defusing a bomb in your living room  of course never forget the performance costs of running av on your servers consider this an opportunity cost also you d need to add x more servers to offer the same performance and throughput if you have specific usage targets this can cost real money    most server-ready av have a non-negligable cost - more opportunity lost and if you re spending security money there are better things to spend it on      all that said if/when you  do  decide to go for av consider the following points including the obvious   coverage  cost  updates  reputation i.e do they actively research? what are their triggers? do they catch what they should? etc    performance or more accurately performance hit - on memory and cpu and throughput  additional engines e.g anti-malware loggers anti-rootkit etc   security  of the product itself! you don t want to introduce vulnerabilities any more than you have to..   very preferable - if you can offload the av scanning to another box e.g appliance or gateway so this isnt even on the server or there are were? some products that let you scan  in memory  via an api call without even writing to disk or db     yes you need antivirus if you are allowing users to upload files to your server  things you can look to choose antivirus   how often is the antivirus updated  determine which features you need and select the one that has those features  performance if it hogs the memory  cost   antivirus is also useful even if the file upload is not required you should not deny the possibility of server being compromised in this case antivirus can help to identify and get rid of backdoors web-shells other nasty stuff besides antivirus additional software can be installed - like anti-rootkits log event notifiers etc,point consid first av fail-saf catch-al mechan malwar even ignor blur line antiviru antimalwar engin function differ even packag singl product av/antimalwar product catch custom target attack code threat tri protect well forget secondli accept file upload user especi essenti anonym user play safe go defens depth - even trivial get around av least block low hang fruit - innoc victim continu spread payload unknowingli third want play super-saf av even need @tate recommend realiz safer virus low probabl still exist free cost involv use av server add risk server sinc ad potenti vulner code - less code less attack surfac even case attack server via av interfac check virus right server necessarili safest option sinc potenti leak fool av also see georg ou zdnet defus bomb live room cours never forget perform cost run av server consid opportun cost also need add x server offer perform throughput specif usag target cost real money server-readi av non-neglig cost - opportun lost spend secur money better thing spend said if/when decid go av consid follow point includ obviou coverag cost updat reput i.e activ research?

[xml files could be created] so the domain would be only available via https,you would still be vulnerable to sslsniff  sslsniff uses arp-spoof to be the mitm what that means is that your vulnerability is to the local lan or wifi  i have not tested the latest sslsniff version to know how it handles the certificate warning but that is the only indication a user has that something is wrong with the setting up of the secure connection to the remote site  https everywhere is only about using ssl whenever it is possible -- i.e automatically using the ssl version of a site if it exists even if the link you typed or followed is for the non-ssl site of the same name that s all https everywhere does  sslsniff is an attack tool to hijack ssl connections it requires two things   a way to intercept incoming and outgoing low-level traffic between the attacked client and server sslsniff primarily relies on arp spoofing for that so the attacker must be on the same lan than either the client or the server  insertion in the client browser of a root ca that the attacker controls or exploit of a security hole in the certificate validation code in the client browser the ssl security model relies on the client validating the certificate with regards to its  a priori  known root ca certificates sslsniff is about using a fake certificate generated on the fly but that certificate must still be acceptable to the client   so there is really no connection between sslsniff and https everywhere sslsniff does  not  degrade https connections to http from the point of view of both the client and the server it is still ssl all the way and https everywhere would feel perfectly happy with it sslsniff is just a tool to leverage breaches in the certificate validation model that ssl uses to ensure security     ...then could an sslsniff attack be successfull against me?     yes      could the attacker get informations because the sslsniff degraded the connection from https to http?     yes    let me add that your description does not exactly fit to how sslsniff works sslsniff acts more like a proxy intercepting ssl traffic instead of simply degrading your connection in other words sslsniff messes with the certificates more than with the https connection itself   this means your addon might actually think everything is fine while in fact your connection is as unsecure as it can get and you would not know about it     or i am fully safe from these kind of attacks when using https everywhere?    no    never expect a browser addon to provide system protection   to give you a human perspective you wouldn t send boyscouts to war either would you? of course not since they would not be fit and able enough to handle the job well neither is a simple browser addon when it comes to ssl security   think about it anyone messing with your browser could mess with the addon in a worst-case scenario the addon could be modified to not even warn you that you ve lost your secure ssl connection while browsing and you would not know about it any virus malware or even new browser exploit would be able depending on it s individual malicious purpose to mess with your system.. including the software on your system which includes your web-browser and it s addons and plugins     update and what happens if i have the domain whitelisted in https everywhere? [xml files could be created] so the domain would be only available via https   getting back to your case and example you re worrying about the https connection your browser might use that connection but it can not be sure the data it s sending or receiving is not being intercepted and neither can any addon actually detecting such an interception can already be pretty hard even when you re using tools of the trade your webbrowser and all the addons out there do not provide any means to detect such an attack not yet anyway.. sslsniff was made to show the weakness of https connections which not only influences webbrowsers it is yet to be seen if browser-vendors will be able to find a solid fix to such vulnerabilities especially since it s less of a browser issue but more of a connection and network security problem and when you ve checked  http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslsniff/  you ll have seen that there s already more trouble waiting for us around the corner this is displayed by the additional functionality the sslsniff tool has gained.. just to display related problems like the one you ve recently learned about and were hoping to fix by using your browser addon  anyway let me keep it short by repeat myself  never expect a browser addon to provide system protection  you may or may not like it but that s the shortest answer to your question wrapping it all up in a single line of understandable text the rest of my rather long answer is merely some useful  decoration  information to provide some insights where needed  the short answer is   no  not always   i have studied this topic in depth and please read this entire post before forming a conclusion  sslsniff is a proof of concept exploitation platform to leverage flaws in the pki  such as  vulnerabilities in ocsp  or the ingenious  null-prefix certificate attack   if you are using a fully patched system  and you understand what an ssl error means then you are immune to  most  but not all of these attacks without the need for https everywhere if you are not patched against the null-prefix certificate attack then the certificate will appear valid and https everywhere will be useless   if you don t understand what an ssl error means then https everywhere is useless against sslsniff  what i think is more concerning than sslsniff is  sslstrip   which is also written by moxie marlinspike and introduced in his talk  new tricks for defeating ssl in practice    this tool won t cause ssl errors   this is exploiting http/https the application layer   if you load a page over http  it will rewrite the page removing https links it will go a step further and change the favicon.ico file to a picture of a lock  to fool novice users  simple enough  but absolutely devastating consequences   in response to this attack google introduced the  strict transport layer security  sts  which is a lot like https everywhere but built into the browser  it should also be noted that https everywhere is really good an defending against the sslstrip attack in fact this is the eff s solution to attacks like ssl strip as well as careless  owasp a9 - insufficient transport layer protection  violations  so when does https everywhere and sts fail?  how about  https://stackoverflow.com   if you notice  they are using a self signed certificate   jeff atwood himself doesn t care about this issue   because this website is using a self signed certificate  http everywhere will forcibly use https  but the attacker can still use sslsniff to deliver their own self signed certificate and therefore https everywhere would fail to protect someone from hijacking your stackoverflow account   okay so at this point you probably are saying to yourself  well that s why we have a pki!  well except the pki isn t perfect  one of the creators of https said the pki was more of a last minute handwave see  ssl and the future of authenticity   in this talk moxie asked a great question is a pki really the best solution?  i mean we are having problems with cas like  diginotor being hacked   when a ca is hacked  then the attacker can create a valid certificate  and then  https everywhere is totally useless   an attacker can still use sslsniff because he has a valid certificate  the  eff s ssl observatory  demonstrates what a tangled mess the pki system is  i mean really  what is stopping china from creating a certificate for gmail.com?   well the eff is proposing the  sovereign keys project  and i think it s a great idea  besides the fact that sovereign keys don t exist as of yet there is another problem   sovereign keys don t help self-signed certificates like the one being used by  https://stackoverflow.com !    however moxie thought of this situation and came up with a solution that he calls  convergence   convergence is relying upon the masses for trust  the host will be contracted from multiple connections around the planet  if any one of them sees a different self-signed certificate  then you know a mitm attack is taking place  having a warning that something is wrong is a lot better than nothing  in summation  there are fundamental problems https everywhere  when there is a vulnerability in software used to validate certificates  when the user doesn t understand the repercussions of an ssl failure  when a self-signed certificate is used then finally when our compromised pki is used against you  this is a serious problem and intelligent people working on fixing it this includes the eff and the author of sslstrip moxie marlinspike  @lancebaynes is it possible you really meant to ask about  sslstrip  rather than  sslsniff ?  sslsniff exploits  a very specific vulnerability  in microsoft ie6  this is fixed in all modern versions of ie and it never affected any other browser -- in particular it never affected firefox  https everywhere is an add-on that is available for firefox  it is not available for ie  therefore https everywhere is completely irrelevant for defending against a vulnerability in ie  it s like apples and oranges  there s nothing a firefox-only add-on could do to defend against a ie-only vulnerability  i suspect you meant to ask about sslstrip  sslstrip is a much more serious attack that remains dangerous today  it is a man-in-the-middle attack that converts your https connections into http connections or convert them into https connections to some other site that the attacker controls and whose domain name looks similar enough that you might not notice  this attack is devastating and difficult for users to detect  https everywhere is designed to defend against sslstrip-like attacks  the way it works is by having a large database of which websites support https  if the website supports https then https everywhere will ensure your browser only uses https to connect to it it will not allow your browser to connect over unencrypted http  thus https everywhere is partly helpful at stopping those sorts of attacks   hsts  is another defense against sslstrip-like attacks  hsts is supported on all modern browsers which is an advantage over https everywhere  however hsts requires the site to opt into protection which is a disadvantage compared to https everywhere  more reading     options when defending against sslstrip?

 if it s an https site you re trying to reach i would imagine it will be a little harder to pull off but i figure they could redirect you to a misspelling of the real domain and then present a similar login page in an attempt to steal your creds,yes this is possible  if haven t manually specified your dns server for the interface you re working on and receive one from dhcp they can just send you to their own malicious dns server and resolve your requests for you  even without a dns server being specified in your interface settings the firewall can be configured to redirect tcp / udp 53 dns to a server of the attackers choosing https makes this exponentially harder to do without convincing the victim to either ignore ssl warnings or install a root ca on the victims box     is it possible for them to intercept your dns queries and replace them with ones that send you to a server under their control?   yes a mitm attacker can intercept your dns queries and change the response to point to a different server the original dns protocol has no built-in security and its queries and responses can be easily modified the  dnssec  protocol is one possible approach to prevent these attacks by adding authentication to dns traffic but not encryption     if it s an https site you re trying to reach i would imagine it will be a little harder to pull off [...]   if it s an https site the attacker can t just connect you to a different server because you browser verifies the site s tls certificate if they try to connect you to their own server when you visit   they won t be able to complete a tls handshake because they don t posess a ca-signed certificate for   consequently your browser would warn you that the connection isn t trusted see  how does ssl/tls work?  for details     they could redirect you to a misspelling of the real domain and then present a similar login page in an attempt to steal your creds   yes that s possible but this only works if the attacker captures any plain http traffic where they can inject their malicious redirect if the victims uses https right from the beginning there is no way for the attacker to redirect you to a different domain  hsts  is a technique to prevent these redirection attacks and downgrade attacks in general it s a http header that websites can send to force users to always visit their site via https after their first visit thereby giving a mitm no opportunity to tamper with any plain http traffic  yes this is possible!when you attach with mitm all connections of the victim s device are routed to yours because of that you can easily fake a hosts file i usually use dnsspoof this is a preinstalled tool of kali linux  you can easily perform the mitm attack whenever you want to visit a webiste like google.com your web browser would initiate a dns packet to the dns server in order to resolve the google.com domain name into an ip address for ip routing but suppose you are a mallicious attacker and use packet sniffing tools then you can easily capture the dns request or reply packet and then easily manipulate the stuff in the packet   it does not matter wether you try to vist http or https website because any website  let it be http or https  first needs a dns resolution   only way to mitigate such attack is to hardwrite the ip address of the website in your host file which is a tedious job or you can use a vpn wherein you can tunnel even the dns traffic to the vpn server and be sure that no attacker can tamper your data while you are on public network,possibl intercept dns queri replac one send server control?

 why does the file name determine whether a file is executable or not?  didn t the nimda worm spread via some problem with .eml files as an example  nobody knew that .eml files were executable at the time  windows has no tradition of separation of privileges indeed it has a tradition of single root-user lots of applications still assume this  windows has no tradition of separation of data from executables  i give you word macros embedded in the .doc file as an example of un-separated data and instructions that have historically caused virus problems  linux has at least traditions opposite to all the above points mildly effective discretionary access controls simple enough to be applied on a day-to-day basis yet comprehensive enough to keep traditional file-type viruses at bay the system call interface is only moderately complicated and since source code is freely available multiple sources of documentation exist executables typically live in bin directories and data lives in another  each executable has its own configuration file rather than sharing the big ol  registry  data files live in per-user directories and almost never contain the kind of all-powerful macros that word etc data files contain  also linux doesn t really exist as windows does  hundreds of distros exist each customizing almost every aspect of low-level details  different compiler versions different linux kernels some all-modular some without modules  that s true of virtually every software aspect of a system from the kernel to email clients  where windows users by-and-large use outlook email clients linux users use an array of hundreds of different clients each in tens of versions  there s no user base for any given version of any given piece of software the user base is not just fractured it s shattered this makes it a lot harder to find a vulnerability on a suitable number of hosts or to write an exploit that would work on a large enough number of instances of software  i m going to knock some of the bad notions here  1 linux is more secure because of less marketshare  not in the server market where public machines get slammed by bots viruses hackers etc all day   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usage_share_of_operating_systems#servers   2 windows is more secure in recent versions  at least at the kernel level you re seeing more cve reports of remote execution exploits and privilege escalation in windows more local dos attacks to a multi-user environment in linux also you ll find more critical cves on windows i had a bunch of statistical breakdowns from a cve database but i can t find that post i made months ago so frustrating! google isn t helping me find it...  as you can see server 2008 has a  much higher  weighted average of cve severity   http://www.cvedetails.com/top-50-product-cvssscore-distribution.php  plus all linux vulnerabilities from the 1.2 days vs the past 5 years of 2008 development!  of course you run with something like ubuntu that comes with a bunch of software and pre-configuration on top of it they re at the whim of the software running on it   my opinion on the subject linux is built around a lot of unix concepts 40  years  of software development and people beating these boxes to death it is secure mainly by unix s trial by fire and this has helped immensely lots of lessons were learned and directly applied to linux      has this got anything to do with the open-source nature of linux?   a lot of it has to do with that at least with the speed at which the higher  volume  of cves are addressed this also allows a lot of smaller issues to be found and fixed mainly due to it s  popularity  because open-source with no popularity means few eyes on the code and little interest to fix     its underlying architecture and the difference from windows?   being built up around a multi-user environment helps a ton these systems were built to have tons of people on them at once and no one user should be able to interrupt another  linux more secure than windows is not necessarily true because windows always ships as a complete operating system while linux has many distribution versions  there are as many advanced security features in linux as in windows but not every linux distro is using them  some of these distros are highly secure and some are not - some do not enforce mac or built-in reliable method caging by default  valid reasons   smaller userbase in linux makes desktop linux a less attractive target  if only 0.1% of computers are running ubuntu 10.04 and your trojan horse only works on that specific version of linux it will likely never catch  if your trojan horse only works on windows xp you still can attack ~25% of the market  often not always more knowledgable and more security conscious userbase  that said oses like ubuntu have made linux more accessible and you can find people doing dumb things on it   furthermore somewhat debatable reasons you could argue that linux often has a more secure design that may not be so true any more as other oses have played catchup     good privilege separation and access controls with  /  that don t really exist in older versions of windows  say you need some new software image editor latex or python etc that doesn t come pre-installed in your os  in linux  99% of the time you use your package manager to automatically download and install cryptographically signed software validated from a chain of trust  it will automatically use this for updates as well so its easy to keep all software system-wide up to date quickly patching security holes  in windows the majority of the time when i need to install something new i have to search the web for it download and install from some random http website that could load their software with spyware/bloatware/trojan horses or i could be subject to a mitm attack and download/install some virus instead and each application has its own different installer/automatic updater  that said i find people too trusting of ppas random scripts on the internet or adding browser extensions as major security vulnerabilities of both linux/windows       your standard connection to another remote machine through ssh is very convenient and powerful which is vastly superior to any windows remote authentication in terms of security  whenever you connect to an ssh machine you cryptographically check that the host key of the other machine hasn t changed from the previously used key you can use your ssh private key to respond to a challenge token without letting eavesdroppers use replay attacks or keyloggers see your password  then all traffic is sent encrypted between the two machines furthermore its trivial to set up on a linux box  a variety of free linux security tools  selinux apparmor wireshark iptables or a wrapper like ufw ssh cron top really htop fail2ban tripwire gpg openssl md5sum/sha256sum etc  it s also very easy to setup scripts scan a log file and email an alert and do everything from the command line etc  granted most all? of these probably have windows equivalents but they tend to either not be free or change a lot between versions  setting up a cronjob is basically to automate some task is pretty much the same as it was for the past 20 years while setting up an automated task in windows will have dramatic changes between oses   not valid reasons   linus s law given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow hence open-source being more secure than closed-source software  i don t find this argument particularly convincing as significant security holes have been found to have existed for months/years in open-source stuff e.g  debian openssl   its even worse as attackers can read the source look for bugs or even try to  introduce disguised bugs into the codebase    however i don t believe that close-sourced software is intrinsically more secure either -- people still make mistakes and you can easily pay someone to introduce holes into a proprietary codebase and with less eyeballs it may be impossible to notice clearly security bugs and backdoors often do exist in close-sourced software and are attacked as well  i consider this one more or less a tie.   imho there are 3 main reasons   until recently mswindows had no effective privilege seperation   linux tends to be used by more technically literate people who will be skeptical about emails proclaiming  i love you   windows has greater market penetration   leaving aside the first point it s debatable whether linux is intrinsically more secure than mswindows imho it is but that s a rather long and boring argument  given that mswindows now has better privilege seperation than it used to it s interesting to note that there is a particular distribution of linux with strong market penetration used by the proletariate and which has a very unusual approach to privilege seperation - which is attracting a lot of malware development effort - android  while i wouldn t recommend not running an anti-virus and firewall on a mswindows machine by far the most important thing you can do to keep your computer clean is to configure it properly and keep up to date with vendor supplied patches  i personally feel that this notion is due to the fact that windows is far more widely used than linux in addition linux is usually used in enterprise environments which should have better security than home systems and networks this might contribute to the thinking that linux is more secure than windows  of course both systems can be vulnerable if not configured properly and patched regularly both systems also has the potential to be secure if set up properly  many current malware programs virus worm trojan spyware target windows based system so there are more antivirus and antimalware applications for windows   but if anybody wants to attack your linux system it is as easy to make harmful program using bash script as it is to use windows scripting,go knock bad notion 1 linux secur less marketshar server market public machin get slam bot virus hacker etc day http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usage_share_of_operating_systems#serv 2 window secur recent version least kernel level see cve report remot execut exploit privileg escal window local dos attack multi-us environ linux also find critic cve window bunch statist breakdown cve databas find post made month ago frustrating! googl help find it... see server 2008 much higher weight averag cve sever http://www.cvedetails.com/top-50-product-cvssscore-distribution.php plu linux vulner 1.2 day vs past 5 year 2008 development! cours run someth ubuntu come bunch softwar pre-configur top whim softwar run opinion subject linux built around lot unix concept 40 year softwar develop peopl beat box death secur mainli unix trial fire help immens lot lesson learn directli appli linux got anyth open-sourc natur linux?

59411,sse,3,0.569233239,authentication|csrf|rest|web-application,how to protect against login csrf,http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf  points out that most csrf protection mechanisms fail to protect login forms as  https://stackoverflow.com/a/15350123/14731  explains     the vulnerability plays out like this         the attacker creates a host account on the trusted domain    the attacker forges a login request in the victim s browser with this host account s credentials    the attacker tricks the victim into using the trusted site where they may not notice they are logged in via the host account    the attacker now has access to any data or metadata the victim created intentionally or unintentionally while their browser was logged in with the host account      this attack has been  successfully employed against youtube   the authors of the paper went on to propose the addition of an origin header but ran into resistance by w3c members  http://lists.w3.org/archives/public/public-web-security/2009dec/0035.html   to date only chrome and safari implements the origin header ie and firefox do not and it s not clear whether they ever will  with that in mind what is the best way to protect against csrf attacks on login forms?   update  i am looking for a restful solution so ideally i want to avoid storing server-side state per user this is especially true for non-authenticated users if it s impossible then obviously i will give up on this requirement,so a slightly niche requirement but hey a valid csrf  there s a couple of choices of how you can address this that spring to mind    standard anti-automation techniques like a captcha  of course not the most user friendly of solutions but can help mitigate other attacks at the same time  have a standard anti-csrf token which is tied to information provided by the client which is available pre-authentication  an obvious option would be to tie it to source ip address  that s not perfect systems behind proxies would have the same address but would reduce the risk quite a bit  another option would be to tie the token to specific browser identities  if you look at  panopticlick  you can see that browsers provide identifying information so it might be possible to create a fingerprint based on that and issue one anti-csrf token for each fingerprint which contacts the site  again not perfect but makes the attack harder to execute   you can apply any of the standard anti-csrf techniques be it the synchronizer token pattern or double submit cookies the former is generally more secure because cookies can be overwritten by subdomains  you claimed that the synchronizer token pattern only works after authentication but this is not the case an attacker does not have access to the token of a user regardless of whether the user is authenticated or not   of course the attacker can visit the login page herself and obtain a valid anti-csrf token but this token  only  works for the attacker if the victim makes a request then the token is not accepted because it s not present in the victim s session in fact the session will be entirely empty on the first request  with anonymous cookies  if you are happy to generate secure tokens which are set as anonymous users  cookies but not to store them server side then you could simply  double submit cookies   e.g legitimate user   anon user navigates to the login page receives cookie which is sent to the browser  anon user logs in and the browser sends the cookie as a header and as a hidden form value  user now logged in   this cannot be abused by the attacker as the following will now happen   the attacker creates a host account on the trusted domain  the attacker forges a login request in the victim s browser with this host account s credentials  however the attacker does not have access to the victim s cookie value and cannot forge it as the csrf token in the request body the attack fails    even if your site is only accessible over https and you correctly set the  secure flag  care must be taken with this approach as an attacker could potentially  mitm   any  connection from the victim to  any  http website if the attacker is suitably placed of course redirect them to your domain over http which is also mitm d and then set the required cookie value this would be a  session fixation  attack to guard against this you could output the cookie value to the header and the hidden form field  every  time this login page is loaded over https rather than reuse any already set cookie value  this is because although a browser can set the secure flag it will still send cookies without the secure flag over a https connection and the server will not be able to tell whether the secure flag was set cookie attributes such as the secure flag are only visible when the cookie is set not when it is read the only thing the server gets to see is the cookie name and value. implementing  hsts  would be a good option for protection in supported browsers  it is advisable to set  x-frame-options  to prevent a ui redress click jacking attack otherwise the attacker could possibly use site functionality to pre fill their username and password awaiting the user to click and submit them along with the csrf value  without anonymous cookies  if you do not want to set cookies for anonymous users which then may suspect that they are being tracked server side then the following approach may be used instead a multi-stage login form  the first stage is the usual username / password combination  after the form is submitted it redirects to another form this form is protected by a special intermediary authentication token cookie and a csrf token the authentication here will only allow the second stage authentication to be submitted but will not allow any other actions on the account except possibly a full logout this will enable the csrf token to be associated and used by this user account only on this intermediary  session  now it is only when this form is submitted including the token cookie and csrf hidden form value that the user is fully authenticated with the domain any attacker attempting a csrf attack will not be able to retrieve the csrf token and their full login attempt will fail  the only drawback is that the user will have to manually click to complete login which may be a clunky user experience it is advisable to set  x-frame-options  to prevent this being used in combination with a ui redress click jacking attack any auto submission with javascript would be beneficial to the attacker and would cause their attack to possibly succeed so at the moment i can only see a manual click by the user working  it would now play out like this   the attacker creates a host account on the trusted domain  the attacker forges a login request in the victim s browser with this host account s credentials  but they cannot proceed past stage two to become fully authenticated   the attacker tricks the victim into using the trusted site -  but as they are not fully authenticated the site will act as though the user is unauthenticated    i d like to propose a variant of the  encrypted token pattern  which works as follows when a client requests an html page needing csrf protection..   the server checks for the existence of a   cookie if it is missing the server sets a new   cookie containing a cryptographically-strong pseudorandom value note this value is not stored on the server but it still protects against login csrf an attacker cannot authenticate without passing through the login form  if the user is logged out return an html page that triggers authentication for unsafe operations go back to step 1  if the user is logged in the server encrypts   using a secret key and embeds the value which we shall call   into the html file it isn t important where   is embedded so long as the form or javascript function making the request can access it   is a cryptographically-strong pseudorandom value used to prevent brute-force attacks on the secret key but is not used during the validation process  forms submit   using a hidden field of the same name javascript functions submit   using a custom request header named    the server decrypts   and compares its value to   if the two donEEEEEEEEEEt match the server returns   and triggers

72324,sse,6,0.409408659,hash|password-management|password-policy|passwords|vulnerability,site allows both partial and complete password authentication do they have my password in plain text,my bank provides online banking facility like most of the banks these days on the web they have partial password authentication although i don t really believe in ppa providing extra security but that could be wrong  my alarm bells started ringing when today i downloaded their mobile banking application for my smartphone that app asks for my complete password  assuming the password is encrypted or hashed how does it allow both ppa and full password authentication?  are my fears correct that they have possibly stored my password in plain text? in that case i will raise a complaint with their it department and disable my account for now because everyone here knows much more than me how insecure would that be   edit   could they be storing each character of my password encrypted individually? that would then allow ppa and complete password authentication by comparing the available characters with their own encrypted versions is that a safe way of storing passwords for ppa,they are probably storing the password encrypted i.e not hashed encryption is reversible so there is no reason why they cannot use code which takes the user input characters decrypts the stored password and checks the input matches the characters in the password  if done correctly the program used to do this would only temporarily store the plaintext in memory and explicitly delete that memory after use so that in the event of a crash the password is not written to a human readable file  though it is of course possible unlikely? that they are using plain text passwords  as an aside...one way around the weakness of not having the password hashed resulting from ppa functionality is to have two levels of password while this does not provide any additional assurance per se it does mean that one password can be stored hashed and always used in full while the other is encrypted and used for ppa  the benefit of ppa is that it can help to defeat keylogging threats even if an attacker has access to screenshots as well they will need to observe and capture key strokes from multiple login events before they will have enough information to launch a successful attack  in order to support partial passwords the bank must necessarily store either the plaintext password or at least some values that would allow fast reconstruction of the complete password it is easily seen in the following way when the bank asks for say the 3rd 4th and 8th letters of the password then there are less than one million possibilities assuming that the letters are printable characters yet the bank can somehow decide whether the three provided letters are the right ones or not therefore whatever the bank stores is sufficient to run a brute force attack on the 3rd 4th and 8th letters and that attack will succeed in less than a million tries  the bank may add layers of encryption and hashing and whatsnot this won t change that raw fact whenever there is support for partial passwords then there is very sensitive storage on the server side in that sense support for partial passwords  decreases  security instead of increasing it it can be argued that partial passwords increase security on the client side  shoulder surfers  gain only a partial view of the password yet you must be aware that this is a trade-off more client-side security for less server-side security.  to support full-password authentication the bank must store something which is sufficient to verify a full password the same reasoning as above applies but for a brute force attack on the complete password not on a partial password if a bank supports both partial passwords and full password authentications then it probably stores one of the following    the full password in a recoverable format plaintext or encrypted with a key that the server knows -- that encryption being protection mostly against casual attackers on the bank side e.g underpaid interns    a hash of the full password and hashes for all password subsets that the bank may ask to the connecting user    the second possibility requires a lot more storage and implementation complexity on the bank side so i deem it improbable developers of bank applications are no less lazy than their fellow humans   take note that your password is  not  your most sensitive asset entrusted to the bank the bank holds your  money  and the money is what the attackers are after if an attacker completely hijacks the authentication server he won t limit himself to grabbing encrypted or hashed passwords he will immediately fake some successful authentication and trigger transfers who needs a key for a door when he is already inside ?  discussions about encrypted or hashed passwords are relevant for  partial  breaches e.g when the attacker finds a backup tape for a database or obtains a read-only view through some sql injection attack in that sort of scenario what can be done by an attacker depends a lot on the subtle details of how things are implemented in the server so it is hard to talk in all generality  quoting  wikipedia      it is good practice to not store passwords in cleartext instead when  checking a whole password it is common to store the result of passing  the password to a cryptographic hash function as the user doesn t  supply the whole password it cannot be verified against a stored  digest of the whole password some have suggested storing the digest  of each combination of letters that could be requested but they note  that this results in generating and storing a large amount of  digests a better solution in terms of storage space and  security is using a secret sharing scheme,order support partial password bank must necessarili store either plaintext password least valu would allow fast reconstruct complet password easili seen follow way bank ask say 3rd 4th 8th letter password less one million possibl assum letter printabl charact yet bank somehow decid whether three provid letter right one therefor whatev bank store suffici run brute forc attack 3rd 4th 8th letter attack succeed less million tri bank may add layer encrypt hash whatsnot chang raw fact whenev support partial password sensit storag server side sens support partial password decreas secur instead increas argu partial password increas secur client side shoulder surfer gain partial view password yet must awar trade-off client-sid secur less server-sid security. support full-password authent bank must store someth suffici verifi full password reason appli brute forc attack complet password partial password bank support partial password full password authent probabl store one follow full password recover format plaintext encrypt key server know -- encrypt protect mostli casual attack bank side e.g underpaid intern hash full password hash password subset bank may ask connect user second possibl requir lot storag implement complex bank side deem improb develop bank applic less lazi fellow human take note password sensit asset entrust bank bank hold money money attack attack complet hijack authent server limit grab encrypt hash password immedi fake success authent trigger transfer need key door alreadi insid ?

     what is the most effective / best method for obtaining information in regards to what vulnerabilities x device has or has had?  is there anything else i can do short of checking the security advisories page?   what if there is no security advisory page where else can i go?  what are some good resources i can use to find such vulnerabilities,there are multiple utilities which can check installed software against the public cve database such as  cve-check-tool  and  cvechecker  these tools will compare your reported software versions against known vulnerable versions but will not attempt to exploit your software many linux distributions also keep a list of distribution-specific security advisories their package managers can often be configured to log instances when you are using software with a known security issue  you can also look on various advisory websites some like  cvedetails  are easy to search through but not always up to date or complete more vendor-specific advisories such as  dsa  for debian go into more detail and are more comprehensive you can also simply search the name and version of your software along with the word cve to get many relevant results this is what i often do another technique is to read the security mailing list for the software or a more general security-oriented mailing list like  oss-sec  which discusses vulnerabilities for popular open source software  a good strategy would be to subscribe to the security mailing list for the technology stack you are operating this can be done via the vendor websites or using updated third party vulnerability databases like  securityfocus  and  exploits database   on  securityfocus   you can browse vulnerabilities history by vendor and product version     what if there is no security advisory page where else can i go?   in this case you are probably among the users who first discovered the vulnerability or less probably you ve been accidentally informed of an undisclosed vulnerability  in this case the only thing you have to do if you are a good guy : is to contact the vendor     what is the most effective / best method for obtaining information in  regards to what vulnerabilities x device has or has had?   checking the vendor s security advisories page is always a good start anything they know about will usually go on there as an example here is a link to the  cisco security advisories  page       is there anything else i can do short of checking the security advisories page?   yes there is for example any major vulnerabilities will be assigned a  cve  these will also be very helpful in identifying whether or not a specific product has x vulnerability or not a good resource for this is  cve details       what if there is no security advisory page where else can i go?   if there isn t a security advisory on the vendor page then a few things could be applicable    the vendor doesn t yet know if they are affected  they re not aware of the vulnerability  they aren t affected   what should you do in this scenario? a good idea would be to contact the vendors support teams going back to the cisco example you could use  cisco tac  this would be applicable to all vendors if there is no public information on the device in question your best chance is to contact their support teams and find out  if they are not aware of the vulnerability it would be a  good  idea to inform them of the issue especially if you found it whilst doing some digging and it appears obscure if you cannot find any resources from the vendor themselves whether they know about it or not inform them i can almost safely say it will help in the cisco example you could contact  product security incident response team        what are some good resources i can use to find such vulnerabilities?   there are a lot of websites you can use other than the ones mentioned the two below might also be helpful as mentioned by @elsadek    securityfocus    exploitdb    you could also use cve checkers as mentioned by @forest    cvecheck-tool    cvechecker    another idea might be to subscribe to a security mailing list like the one below originally mentioned by @forest   open source security mailing list   this specifically is quite generalised however there are ones you could use which are more specific as i mentioned earlier you could subscribe to ciscos for example  generally exploits are given cve numbers which can be searched for on  https://www.cvedetails.com/  you can look at exploits by vendor by product etc  i agree with all of the above in addition you can use  https://vulners.com/  to search for a product even with a specific version number  vulners basically enumerates cve s and vulnerability reports as well as security focused blogs and posts from across the internet you can then search for anything that may be contained in these documents  i started using it due to their robust api which makes things even easier i believe they have a method of setting up a vulnerability scanner as well,effect / best method obtain inform regard vulner x devic had?

 also if a foreign computer is riddled with malware is it safe to assume that booting the system to a usb os will keep the usb os safe from the windows malware on the machine?  thanks,how aware is the user?   it would be trivial to craft a clumsy poor bit of malware that mounted any local discs and did something such malware would have to ask for permission but there was a spate of malware that did pretty much that and many users clicked yes  examples exist of poorly crafted malware that had to ask the user for permission before it could do damage very many users gave permission not knowing what they were doing it would be trivial to create malware like that  worse the attacker wouldn t need to  malware could make use of privilege escalation or other exploits to cause damage to the local file system  puppy runs as root  the puppy linux wiki has some interesting thoughts and guidelines about security: http://puppylinux.org/wikka/security      n.b choice of operating system becomes irrelevant if recommended security precautions are not applied   it is possible but it is quite unlikely   however making sure wouldn t take too much effort you just need to boot from a read only medium   this can be achieved by using a usb drive with a  read only  mode whilst these are few and far between similar results can be achieved by using an sd card most sd cards have  read only  mode and can be placed in a usb sd card reader this would make it impossible for a virus to spread from the disk to your portable media  it all depends on the configuration of your os be it usb stick-ed or not  if your live system enable you to write in one way or an other to the physical disk of your home computer then there is a non null probability that the computer could get infected take for example a virus that would copy itself on the mbr of your main disk  concerning infection from the main computer to the live os it is not impossible too the thing is that if the malware is a resident one loaded when you read you disk it won t be running on your live system because the boot sequence of the infected os won t be run.but if you have some latent viruses in your files and that virus would know how to target your live os system then opening this file with a vulnerable application or executing it can trigger infection of your live os  in conclusion it s up to you to configure your os to take the precautions needed to your operations in fact if you don t want to infect or get infected the best thing to do is to disconnect the drives from the machine if this is not an option you would need to take care of the options on the live os read-only mode no exec mode no auto mounting of disks running with the least privileges ...  one way to consider this is to ask yourself do  i  have the ability to mount the host os disk and modify files?  if you can do it as a user it can be done as a script like others have mentioned it s unlikely that it will happen but it wouldn t be impossible for someone to write a script that detects what version of linux you re using then check for devices in /dev then try to mount any of the hard drive devices found then search those mount points for a windows directory or any other sort of evidence that a windows system is present once all this is discovered they could then proceed to replace dlls or delete the sam file or do any other sort of terror to infect your machine  if you boot from a usb-based os then get infected the virus can still mount the drives and infect them  likewise a virus can infect the live distro on the usb stick by writing files to the drive bypassing the normal mechanisms used to prevent this -- unless you have the physical write-protect switch on  if the system is already infected it may have a virus lodged in the bios the motherboard bios the video card bios the network card bios etc. these things are just flash memory and are updatable by viruses  unless you are the nsa however you don t have to worry about such things in practice booting a live distro from a usb stick is perfectly safe for almost everyone,depend configur os usb stick- live system enabl write one way physic disk home comput non null probabl comput could get infect take exampl viru would copi mbr main disk concern infect main comput live os imposs thing malwar resid one load read disk run live system boot sequenc infect os run.but latent virus file viru would know target live os system open file vulner applic execut trigger infect live os conclus configur os take precaut need oper fact want infect get infect best thing disconnect drive machin option would need take care option live os read-onli mode exec mode auto mount disk run least privileg ..,,virus|bypass|malware|attacks|exploit|protection|vulnerability|privilege escalation,8,26,886,0.029345372,3/8/2011 9:58,DH,Wants to know if a USB OS is malware safe. ,"Ex, AT",Explains the scenarios that may or may not get infected and steps for prevention.

   if you re using windows your box is requesting information from the internet however this isn t needed by an attacker a simple mass scan of random ip addresses can get you and anyone else who is vulnerable here s an example  let s say your ip address is   a mass scanner could simply scan   and attempt to send malicious data over the network maybe they ve found a way to exploit typical windows services which are listening and they re attempting to mass-infect this way they don t necessarily know who you are as tilman said they re blindly attempting to infect random machines on the internet     is my pc publicly announcing that it connected to the internet?    are you using windows? then yes yes it is it s attempting to connect to a microsoft server to check for updates and to check for internet connectivity   are you using a version of linux that is capable of updating? then yes it is connecting to the internet to check for updates and possibly to phone home ubuntu   both windows and linux do the same thing in general phone home / connect to updater services  but you re being needlessly worried about it and it isn t something that should affect you negatively unless there s a vulnerability in the updating programs      how can i prevent an attacker from finding my pc on the internet?   you could block all incoming and outgoing connections but i suspect this would be quite detrimental to your experience otherwise you should just patch as soon as possible to limit your potential attack space    i heard that your pc can get infected just by connecting to the internet even without the web   note that the source you linked does not say you can get infected  by connecting  to the internet but  if you re connected  to the internet connecting to the internet does not trigger an attack it just opens the door for it   assuming i m connected to a private home network how can an attacker tell that i just connected to the internet if i m not browsing the internet or doing something else that requests information from a server on the internet?   s/he can t and doesn t need to active attacks are continuously and blindly sent to all ip addresses without bothering to check who if anybody is connected the moment you connect to the internet these attacks start arriving at your border router   is my pc publicly announcing that it connected to the internet?

41170,sse,6,0.691052675,certificates|digital-signature|man-in-the-middle|tls,how to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks beside of ssl,i would like to discuss this scenario   there is a https service which responds with signed keys to an authenticated client these signed keys can be used for another service to return very sensible data let s assume that because of some internal security hole unexperienced internship exposed ssh key on git server somebody sent the ssl ca with an email ... a person gets the certificate and now can encrypt every connection and just listen on the server responding with one of the signed security keys which he can use to access the sensible data of the other service  is there any technique which could make the signed security key invalid when a man-in-the-middle attack may have occurred maybe a second ssl tunnel,it sounds like what you re asking is  how do i prevent a mitm if my private key may be compromised?  and to that the answer is  get a new private key  and therefore new certificate   if your security policy is so disastrous that an intern is able to upload your ssl private key to github then  that  is your problem private keys are  private  and need to be protected as such no one should have access to your private key which means that people should be physically or technologically prevented from accessing it just instituting a policy saying do not upload the private key to usenet isn t enough you have to actually  prevent  unwanted access to private data  unless you can do that you have no hope of maintaining any semblance of data security   also  you seem to be confusing the private key with the certificate you can do whatever you want with the certificate which includes signed certificates email it to friends post it on your facebook wall publish it to github anything is safe but the  private key  never should leave the computer where it was generated  well there are many options other than ssl to prevent a man in the middle attack but most all of them have a similar cryptographic basis  fundamentally to ensure that a communication can t be attacked by a man in the middle you must be able to prove that a both parties can validate the other and b that no other party can monitor the communication    both of these are most commonly accomplished through a shared secret  asymmetric cryptographic operations can also be used where both parties have a trusted public key for the other however this is much more difficult computationally than exchanging a shared secret and then using that  the shared secret can either be pre-shared such as in the case of an encrypted wifi network or it can be negotiated through an authentication process  for example with ssl the server validates itself to the client through signing the public key the client then establishes a shared secret with the server by using the server s trusted certificate and the server then validates the client through a traditional login or possibly a client certificate in rare cases.  this general process is not unique to ssl but the basic steps of verifying identity of one or both parties and establishing a secure communications key is the critical bits  if however the root of the trust for that certificate was compromised it would be possible for someone to man in the middle since they could pretend to be the server and open their own connection with the server and their own connection with the client  in the event of a private key leaking the certificate should be revoked via a revocation list  this is generally published by a ca and is included as part of the signed certificate  as a condition of validating the validity of the certificate the revocation list should be checked for validity  as mitm take place in the key exchange phase you can apply  id-based encryption   where the public key is the recipient s id to prevent it,well mani option ssl prevent man middl attack similar cryptograph basi fundament ensur commun attack man middl must abl prove parti valid b parti monitor commun commonli accomplish share secret asymmetr cryptograph oper also use parti trust public key howev much difficult comput exchang share secret use share secret either pre-shar case encrypt wifi network negoti authent process exampl ssl server valid client sign public key client establish share secret server use server trust certif server valid client tradit login possibl client certif rare cases. gener process uniqu ssl basic step verifi ident one parti establish secur commun key critic bit howev root trust certif compromis would possibl someon man middl sinc could pretend server open connect server connect client event privat key leak certif revok via revoc list gener publish ca includ part sign certif condit valid valid certif revoc list check valid,,leak|attacks|protection|man in the middle,4,14,669,0.020926756,24/08/2013 18:06,HT,Wants to know different methods for defending against mitm,"AT, Ex",Describes and explains methods for mitm protection

27770,sse,11,0.492832571,disk-encryption|truecrypt|usb-drive,securing my usb flash drive with truecrypt and freeotfe,i want to know if i encrypt my flash with truecrypt  encrypt a non-system partition/drive  option and then mount it and then make a container with freeotfe on the truecrypt encrypted drive and then put my data on the freeotfe container to make it super secure   is this a secure way or does it make it more weaker opening some possible attacks because the data is encrypted with freeotfe then with truecrypt,the best way to examine this kind of setup is to consider your attack scenario there are two main ones that i can think of   an attacker has access to your encrypted device and is attempting to brute-force the password or key  you are being forced either by law or threats to divulge your password   your nested encryption doesn t really solve either issue  if the attacker  can  break the password on the tc volume you re either using a bad password or they have the resources to attempt a ridiculous number of passwords per second this only means that you re giving them a second volume to crack which just doubles the attack time rather than providing any significant protection you d be better off just using a better password on a truecrypt volume  if you re being forced to give up your password you certainly wouldn t be able to get away with giving up the tc volume password but not the inner freeotfe volume again no benefit here  the only differences i can see are the following   if a flaw is found in the cryptographic mechanisms in either piece of software but not both you still retain a reasonable expectation of security  you increase your attack surface for various local vulnerabilities slightly in the case where untrusted files are placed on the internal volume this is unlikely to be exploitable but it s worth thinking about  the two systems are  not  designed to work in unison which might lead to interesting specially-tailored attacks for example having a block encrypted by one piece of software and then another might result in a timing attack or other side-channel attacks   my advice would be to stick with truecrypt and just use cascaded ciphers and a decent password which gives you reasonable protection against vulnerabilities found in any single cipher  using more than one layer of encryption adds more complexity and very little security  modern encryption ciphers rarely suffer catastrophic failures but software implementations are not that perfect using multiple disk encryption tools may decrease your risk in case one of them will have a known flaw or backdoor that will make your stored data vulnerable by the  same line of reasoning  running multiple encryption tools increases the risk that one of those tools might have an  active backdoor  or exploit that would compromise your whole system including the data you want to protect that backdoor might be placed by the author or by attackers breaking into the author s computer or the website that servers the tool even the act of downloading multiple encryption tools might put you on the list of suspicious citizens in some countries or interesting targets you have something important to protect  the  overall confidentiality  of your data depends on many factors not just encryption focusing on doing one layer of encryption right provides most of the security encryption  can  provide the effort of using multiple encryption levels can be directed to improving other factors such as physical security computing environment security os browser etc and key security   reducing the complexity of your whole system and managing the overall risk is the right mentality   and remember  encryption is both a blessing and a curse for security   there is a tool to perform dictionary attacks on free otfe volumes -http://code.google.com/p/luks-volume-cracker/ however due to the intentional complexity of key generation it can only try around 3 keys / second  there are memory key stealing attacks available for both truecrypt and freeotfe and more will be released later this year as part of the dc3 forensics competition  the underlying algorithms however are

57832,sse,10,0.636225522,attack-prevention|file-upload|javascript,how to ensure that files uploaded by users do not contain any javascript,i m trying to make a file uploader using  primefaces  but it is vulnerable to scripts if someone tries to upload a file e.g a rÃ©sumÃ© that includes javascript this could get executed once the file upload is completed  are there efficient ways to detect javascript code? i know parsing the file can detect the code but i consider parsing every file that s uploaded a bad idea because it consumes processing power,the file needs to be inspected before storing it to detect embedded javascript code you ll have no other option than parsing the entire contents of the file  you definitely have to look into that file to ensure that there s no javascript in there but that could be as simple as searching for tokens like       and    f.e not sure whether this is sufficient... of course when doing this these letters can t occur any more in regular content so if your  personal  definition of parsing is  doing complex operations on the file like f.e building a parse tree of it  then this is a solution without parsing  however the preferrable solution to your problem would be to make sure no javascript can be executed no matter whether it s in the file or not  what you are trying to do is to prevent a cross-site scripting xss attack you could attempt to run some string replacements to replace certain characters with their html entities like   with   to prevent a web browser from recognizing them as code to execute while still displaying them the way the user entered them but when it comes to security it is always better to trust a proven solution than to roll your own   there are a lot of edge-cases which allow to embed javascript in html you might forget about but when you use a well-known library designed by web security specialists and recommended by other equally capable specialists you can assume that they have these eventualities covered   there are many libraries available especially for this purpose you tagged this question as java so i assume that you are using java jsp? for your server-sided programming the question  xss prevention in java  on stackoverflow lists some libraries you can use   try to sanitize user inputs as soon as the server receives it the longer you keep the unsanitized strings around the higher the risk that they leak somewhere like into an error message in a log which someone then views with a web browser  you should not be attempting to do this as there is no way you will detect all malicious script there are various ways of hiding it as it isn t all nicely presented within   tags take this one for example   check out the  xss filter evasion cheat sheet  for some other examples  if you are displaying the uploaded files in html then you should set a  content security policy  to prevent inline javascript and css from running using css it is possible to embed javascript some versions of internet explorer support this  the csp can prevent inline script but allow script to run in external   files from your server or from trusted sources such as google cdn  you would need to make sure that you validate that the browser supports csp first you could implement a test for this in a page before displaying the content and you could do this in combination with a html sanitizer that processes the page content only on  output  to the browser this will be a belt and braces approach you should use a well tested solution for the sanitization such as  owasp antisamy  vulnerabilities have been found in older versions of most sanitizers even this one but using it in combination with a csp would prevent most attacks as this would give you the window of time to patch to the latest version  the other option would be to add the  content disposition  header to any served content so that it would be downloaded to the user s machine rather than displaying in a browser in the context of your domain any code running in the context of your domain can take advantage of the  same origin policy  to attack users viewing the content this would not be possible offline internet explorer gives a warning message with confirmation prompt and browsers such as chrome and firefox treat the file system as the   origin to stop the script accessing online content  you basically have two options here    parse the files and make sure you get it right  you can t just remove script tags you also need to remove attributes that enable scripting make sure links don t have javascript scheme uris etc  if you choose this route i suggest using something like  owasp java html sanitizer  rather than trying to implement it yourself as it s non-trivial    stop caring about it  put the files where they can t do any harm  this is an approach taken by many sites that serve up user-generated content  if the pages are served from an origin that doesn t contain sensitive content &amp doesn t have sensitive cookies then an xss is not able to compromise anything  if you serve the files from useruploadedcontent.com then due to  sop  the scripts are only able to interact with useruploadedcontent.com and not domainwithsensitivecookies.com,attempt way detect malici script variou way hide nice present within tag take one exampl check xss filter evas cheat sheet exampl display upload file html set content secur polici prevent inlin javascript css run use css possibl emb javascript version internet explor support csp prevent inlin script allow script run extern file server trust sourc googl cdn would need make sure valid browser support csp first could implement test page display content could combin html sanit process page content output browser belt brace approach well test solut sanit owasp antisami vulner found older version sanit even one use combin csp would prevent attack would give window time patch latest version option would add content disposit header serv content would download user machin rather display browser context domain code run context domain take advantag origin polici attack user view content would possibl offlin internet explor give warn messag confirm prompt browser chrome firefox treat file system origin stop script access onlin content,www.owasp.org | www.html5rocks.com | stackoverflow.com | en.wikipedia.org,leak|owasp|attacks|sanitization|vulnerability|malicious script|sensitive cookie|attack prevention|cross site scripting,9,22,902,0.024390244,13/05/2014 7:37,HT,Wants to know how to sanitise input,"AT, ES",Describes proper practices for this

194228,sse,11,0.45631030200000006,attacks|man-in-the-middle|port-knocking|surveillance,hide ports being knocked during port knocking,a while ago i wrote an  article  about implementing port knocking using iptables later in the post i also talked about making this mechanism more secure the way it works is that in order to open a port like ssh port to connect you need to knock some other close ports if you knock those ports in correct sequence your final port in this case ssh port 22 will become open to connection  recently i realized that any person even with passive surveillance over the network can detect the series of ports to knock a simple mitm attack like  arp spoofing  within the sub-network reveals the ports to be knocked easily  i was curious to know if there exists anyway other than randomizing the ports each time to  conceal the port numbers from the attacker,obviously this is a bit of a frame-challenge so i understand if you don t like this answer  however  the biggest advantage in my mind of port knocking is that it automatically filters out all the bots on the internet that go around randomly trying to brute-force every ssh server they find  it can also be helpful in that it provides a small additional layer of protection against 0-day vulnerabilities in the ssh server if no one knows your server is there then they can t attempt a 0-day even if you are vulnerable  however the point in both of these cases is the same   port knocking is most effective as a way of filtering out drive-by attacks against your server   once you talk about a directed attack i.e someone with a mitm observing the port knocking process then port knocking will definitely fail as a security method  even if there was a way to hide the port combinations from a dedicated attacker the fact that they are specifically targeting your organization means that your port knocking security has accomplished its particular job  it is simply supposed to keep out drive-by attackers and it does as much  attempting to extend it to cover more targeted attacks which this security method wasn t originally designed for is probably going to cause you more trouble than it is worth in the implementation and support of new security feature and the risk of accidentally locking yourself out   can  you hide the port knocking sequence from a mitm attacker?  i m pretty sure the answer is no although i m not ready to make a definitive statement there  either way though i think you re going to make a big headache for yourself to attempt to mitigate an attack vector with a defense mechanism that wasn t really designed for it  as a result i think you re better off finding other ways of securing your servers and keeping your port knocking simple  you re probably already doing this but simply turning off password-based authentication and allowing authentication via private-keys only is usually the first and most effective security measure for an ssh server and imo a more effective way of blocking out drive-by attacks than port knocking  port knocking is essentially a non-standard protocol so too is running non-standard ports you can do this or invent a miriad of other non-standard protocols but you need to consider your purpose   if the the primary point is to handle attacks then something like fail2ban setup along the lines of    if 3 password failures in less than 2 minutes block source ip for 30 minutes   this will drop automated bot attacks from thousands per day to few to none in short order actual fat fingering by people can wait out the block  add in standard tls encrypted connections with certificate verification and you can handle the mitm threat you can even add in client certs if you feel the need  custom protocols are almost always a bad idea or difficult to use at best  if a deeper level of hiding is desired then consider a tor hidden service,obvious bit frame-challeng understand answer howev biggest advantag mind port knock automat filter bot internet go around randomli tri brute-forc everi ssh server find also help provid small addit layer protect 0-day vulner ssh server one know server attempt 0-day even vulner howev point case port knock effect way filter drive-bi attack server talk direct attack i.e someon mitm observ port knock process port knock definit fail secur method even way hide port combin dedic attack fact specif target organ mean port knock secur accomplish particular job simpli suppos keep drive-bi attack much attempt extend cover target attack secur method origin design probabl go caus troubl worth implement support new secur featur risk accident lock hide port knock sequenc mitm attacker?

38037,sse,10,0.423613071,tls|web-application|web-browser,in what way is a partially encrypted webpage insecure,what are the potential vulnerabilities that might arise if a webpage is only partially encrypted   i can think of 2 possibilities    you can change the non-encrypted parts of the page html css images js through a mitm attack to partially change the look of the page    you could inject malicious js through the insecure connection in order to steal/modify the encrypted parts of the page thus rendering the entire connection insecure    is the 2nd scenario possible or do web browsers incorporate some security mechanisms to prevent it from happening?  this question also has implications with regards to the stack exchange n/w since only the iframe containing the login form inside the login page is encrypted   https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/96004/login-to-stack-exchange-account-doesnt-use-https-ssl    update  as @ladada pointed out this question is actually broken into multiple parts  case 1 an insecure page loading a secure iframe to transmit confidential data   answer  as davidwebster48 pointed out in his answer this mechanism is trivially defeated since the insecure parent page can be manipulated to load the iframe with a different page of the  attacker s liking as a side note this means that stackexchange s login system is vulnerable to mitm attacks despite using https login forms  case 2 a secure page loading an insecure page via an iframe  assuming no confidential data is handled by the insecure iframe this case is particularly interesting in that same-origin policies also come into the equation even if both pages may be from the same domain since they both use different protocols one https and the other http this will cause same-origin restrictions to kick in i am not sure whether these restrictions are enough to stop our attacker dead in his tracks  case 3 a secure page linking to insecure js   my answer  i think this is obviously a fail since the attacker could modify the js file to access/manipulate the entire page  case 4 a secure page linking to insecure sources like images css  could the attacker change enough of the look of the page to do a phishing attack? or could he mount a cross-site scripting attack,"let s examine each case from the perspective of an  active  attacker malroy and a  passive  attacker eve   case 1 an insecure page loading a secure iframe to transmit confidential data    passive  you re secure against passive attacks while you use the secure iframe however in the case of log-in iframes if your session token is ever sent in the clear eve can impersonate you i still count impersonation as passive here since eve is not actively tampering with your connection she s just making her own connections with new information she learned.   active  if the html page itself is insecure you ve already totally lost you can have every subresource on the page be securely transmitted but it doesn t matter malroy has already rewritten your page to use totally different resources   case 2 a secure page loading an insecure page via an iframe    passive  obvious major problem here anything you do in the iframe is in plain view however eve can t see what you do in the top-level secure page still the user is left confused about what elements on the page can be interacted with securely and which can t   active  malroy can make anything appear in the iframe i hope you weren t using it for anything important i don t  think  there s any way for malroy to break out of the iframe and read or alter your outer secure page because browsers already assume cross-origin iframes are not trustworthy if there were a way to break out of the iframe i think it would be considered a serious security bug in your browser which isn t to say those don t exist but that s an implementation problem not a theoretical issue with mixed content   case 3 a secure page linking to insecure js    passive  eve can learn what https site you are viewing based on what http resources you load granted she might be able to do this over a secure connection based on destination ip address and size/pattern of the encrypted resources you fetch regardless http only makes things easier for her.   active  as you guessed malroy can make your https page completely rewrite itself by feeding it an altered script   case 4 a secure page linking to insecure sources like images css    passive  same as case 3 above   active  css is pretty powerful if malroy could rewrite a css resource he could do some pretty heavy presentation manipulation as an example perhaps malroy re-styles a the inputs fields of a forum s create new thread page to look like a log-in page this tricks the user into thinking his session has timed out and he unwitting submits his credentials as a public new post  an active attacker could also use css to prompt a client to participate in a csrf attack e.g by using    a possibility that pops into my mind is session high-jacking if the session cookie for example is transfered in a non-secured manner then this could be high-jacked   this page has an excellent explanation and demo  http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/06/the-security-futility-that-is-embedding.html   if you assume the attacker can change the non-encrypted parts of a page then he will be able to change them so that they include his own malicious login form instead of the secure login form  a possible scenario for case 4 is one where a mitm replaces an image withone that exploits an rce remote code execution vulnerability in the user s browser  here s an example of such vulnerability  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-2416 --basically you can serve a crafted image containing executable codeand have that code executed on older versions of macos and ios  of course such mitm could run the code in the context of any page,but assuming that they can t escape the sandbox it s the mixed contentissue that allows them to run code in the context of an otherwise secure page.http pages are insecure anyway as anyone can inject anything there  and it can be javascript or webassembly",let

186657,sse,12,0.416398615,hash|md5|sha256,is it secure to use md5 to verify the integrity of small files less than 15kb,i know that collision for md5 has been documented since the 90s and that digital certificates based off of md5 has been demonstrated to be completely compromised back in 2010 but how effective is md5 in ensuring that small amounts of data have not been tampered with?   i have some small text files that are a few pages in size let s say 15kb in size i ve been using sha-256 on them but it would be much more convenient to be able to use md5 instead  how secure would md5 be as a hash digest for these small 15kb text files? would a malicious party be able to produce collisions for such a small amount of data or does the small size make this a difficult endeavor,the size of the input is irrelevant in fact because of the  birthday paradox  you don t need any more than the size of the hash to make collisions guaranteed the best way to avoid collisions is to use a stronger hash which is not vulnerable to them such as sha-2 however you are describing a more difficult attack than a collision attack called a  preimage attack  which md5 is safe from  there are three types of attacks *  that result in having two files with the same digest     1st preimage  - find an input that resolves to a specific hash     2nd preimage  - modify an input without changing the resulting hash     collision  - find any two distinct inputs that have the same hash    these are called attacks when they can be carried out more efficiently than by brute force search collisions can still occur naturally and in fact they are guaranteed with any non-trivial amount of input due to the  pigeonhole principle  but hashes are designed to make it difficult to  intentionally  perform for a hash with an output the size of md5 s the chance of a random accidental collision is extremely low even if you hash 6 billion random files  per second  it would take 100 years before you get a 50% chance of two hashes colliding md5 is  great  for detecting accidental corruption  a strong  n -bit hash function is designed to have a security level of 2  n   against both 1st and 2nd preimage attacks and a security level of 2  n /2  against collision attacks for a 128-bit hash like md5 this means it was designed to have a security level of 2 128  against preimages and 2 64  against collisions as attacks improve the actual security level it can provide is slowly chipped away  md5 is  vulnerable to a collision attack  requiring the equivalent of only 2 18  hash invocations instead of the intended 2 64  to exploit unless the attacker generates  both  files it is not a collision attack  ûû   an attacker who has a file and wants to maliciously modify it without the hash changing would need to mount a 2nd preimage attack which is  completely infeasible  against md5 with modern technology the  best attack  has a complexity of 2 123.4  compared to md5 s theoretical maximum of 2 128  collision attacks are relevant in different situations for example if you are given an executable made by an attacker without a backdoor you may hash it and save the hash that executable could then later be replaced with a backdoored version yet the hash would be the same as the benign one! this is also a problem for  certificates  where someone could submit a certificate for a domain they do own but the certificate would intentionally collide with one for a domain they do not own  it is safe to use md5 to verify files as long as the stored hash is not subject to tampering and can be trusted to be correct and as long as the files being verified were not created or influenced! by an attacker it may still be a good idea to use a stronger hash however simply to prevent a potential practical preimage attack against md5 in the future from putting your data at risk if you want a modern hash that is very fast but still cryptographically secure you may want to look at  blake2    * while there are other attacks against md5 such as length extension attacks that affect all merkleûûdamgûerd hashes as mentioned by @lieryan these are not relevant for verifying the integrity of a file against a known-correct hash     ûû  a variant of the collision attack called a  chosen-prefix collision attack  is able to take two arbitrary messages prefixes and find two values that when appended to each message results in a colliding digest this attack is more difficult to pull off than a classic collision attack like the length extension attack this only applies to merkleûûdamgûerd hashes   the size of the file doesn t make a difference md5 is based on  merkleûûdamgûerd construction  which is vulnerable to the  length extension attack  15kb is plenty to do the length extension attack there are plenty of known collisions and methods to generate md5 collisions that are just a few hundreds bytes in length and once a base collision is found being vulnerable to length extension means that they can be used to generate an arbitrary number of further collisions  it depends on what you want to defend yourself against  security is never a one-size-fits-all game if it were then there would not be 12941 different hash algorithms instead you need to understand that every security measure defends you against a specific sort of attack you put a password in your computer to defend against random people accessing it not because it s so fun to type   whenever you log in  as for hash algorithms you can grossly classify them as cryptographic hashes and non-cryptographic hashes cryptographic hash algorithms are designed to withstand a number of attacks while non-cryptographic hashes are designed to be as fast as possible 1  md5 for example is considered a cryptographic hash but so broken that it s only usable as a non-cryptographic hash  when to use a non-cryptographic hash  if your goal is to detect bit-flips when copying a file from one location to another say a thumb drive to a laptop then md5 is absolutely the right choice i would even go as far as saying any  fast non-cryptographic hash  is good when you copy files you realistically do not need to fear attacker interference if you are paranoid about hackers being able to modify your kernel then adding hashes will not solve your problems  verifying file integrity with attacker interference  if you intend to sign and publish those files then an attacker might have the ability to craft a possibly legitimate file with t,size input irrelev fact birthday paradox need size hash make collis guarante best way avoid collis stronger hash vulner sha-2 howev describ difficult attack collis attack call preimag attack md5 safe three type attack * result two file digest 1st preimag - find input resolv specif hash 2nd preimag - modifi input without chang result hash collis - find two distinct input hash call attack carri effici brute forc search collis still occur natur fact guarante non-trivi amount input due pigeonhol principl hash design make difficult intent perform hash output size md5 chanc random accident collis extrem low even hash 6 billion random file per second would take 100 year get 50% chanc two hash collid md5 great detect accident corrupt strong n -bit hash function design secur level 2 n 1st 2nd preimag attack secur level 2 n /2 collis attack 128-bit hash md5 mean design secur level 2 128 preimag 2 64 collis attack improv actual secur level provid slowli chip away md5 vulner collis attack requir equival 2 18 hash invoc instead intend 2 64 exploit unless attack gener file collis attack EEEEE  attack file want malici modifi without hash chang would need mount 2nd preimag attack complet infeas md5 modern technolog best attack com,en.wikipedia.org | eprint.iacr.org | crypto.stackexchange.com | link.springer.com | lwn.net | blake2.net,attacks|exploit|backdoor|vulnerability|malicious file,5,47,1859,0.02528241,29/05/2018 3:21,DH,Wants to know if md5 is secure for small file verification,"DC, Ex, ES",States that file size is irrelevant and explains collision attacks.

i don t think any av vendor would allow me to submit a   file a few hundred megabytes in size for analysis   thanks for your time,this video file uses well abuses windows media player s drm functionalities which allows content providers to embed an url in their protected content that will be displayed in a windows media player window to allow the user acquire a license to play the content its legitimate usage goes like this    user registers on an online music store and downloads some drm-protected files which have their actual media content encrypted  user opens them in windows media player it opens a window with the url specified in the media file in this case a legitimate url from the music store which asks for the user s login  user enters his credentials the music store authenticates them and gives wmp the decryption key which is then cached and the file can now be played   in this case the feature has been abused to display a fake wmp error about missing codecs it s in reality a webpage as the domain name in the top bar suggests and if it was real the window would ve been much smaller to make you click a fake button that points to malware masquerading as codecs  there s some more info about this drm system on  wikipedia  and it seems to be deprecated in favour of playready whether this new iteration will allow such abuse isn t yet known  the wmv file in question was probably crafted to exploit a vulnerability in windows media player the explicit request to use windows media player to play it points in that direction it was probably intended to steer victims away from other players which wouldn t be vulnerable to the exploit  the vulnerability was then exploited to request download of a malware program disguised as a codec installation package a popular ploy since users would expect codec installation when playing a media file,video file use well abus window media player drm function allow content provid emb url protect content display window media player window allow user acquir licens play content legitim usag goe user regist onlin music store download drm-protect file actual media content encrypt user open window media player open window url specifi media file case legitim url music store ask user login user enter credenti music store authent give wmp decrypt key cach file play case featur abus display fake wmp error miss codec realiti webpag domain name top bar suggest real window would much smaller make click fake button point malwar masquerad codec info drm system wikipedia seem deprec favour playreadi whether new iter allow abus yet known,en.wikipedia.org,virus|hijack|trojan|malware|exploit|protection|vulnerability,7,16,998,0.016032064,22/11/2015 15:27,DC,Doesn't understand behaviour of a .wmv file.

  well the same thing as always install patches from your software vendors as a matter of fact this should go without saying  on the client side microsoft has already patched internet explorer to refuse to use a too small modulus a fix for firefox in the form of a plugin by mozilla is available  here  now it is expected that other browser vendorsopera chrome... will soon follow  on the server side you can explicitly disable support for export cipher suites and generate your own dh parameters see  that page  for details note that   is kind of immune to all of this because apparently it never supported dhe cipher suites with anything else than a dss server certificate and nobody uses dss server certificates  note that  ecdhe  cipher suites in which ec meaning elliptic curve are not at risk here because   there are no export ecdhe cipher suites ecdhe cipher suites were defined after the us export regulations were considerably lifted  clients in general support only a few specific curves usually only two of them p-256 and p-384 and neither is weak enough to be broken not now not in the foreseeable future either     and what about the nsa ?   the logjam researchers include some talk about how some attackers with nation-state resources could break through 1024-bit dh this is quite a stretch in my experience nation-states indeed have a lot of resources and are good at spending it but that s not the same thing as succeeding at breaking hard crypto  nevertheless if you fear that 1024-bit dh is too weak,go for 2048-bitthis is the recommended one anyway or ecdhe  or simply accept that people with overwhelming resources really have  overwhelming resources  and won t be defeated by a simple modulus size those who can spend billions of dollars for cracking machines can also bribe your kids with a few hundreds of dollars to go through your computer files and your wallet  logjam shouldn t really be called a new vulnerability - it s a rehash of freak which targets export-grade dh rather than export-grade rsa  practical exploitation relies on the following flaws   the tls protocol is vulnerable to having its key exchange protocol downgraded by an attacker  servers are still supporting export-grade diffie-hellman e.g 512-bit keys  for performance reasons many implementations hard-code a common prime this nuance can be abused in order to precompute part of an attack ahead of time for any server which uses that prime   the attack essentially allows an attacker to precompute a set of data for a target prime known to be in use by a tls service in its dh implementation for 512-bit dh this is known to take about a week once this has been done the attacker can break the dh key exchanges with that service in about 1-2 minutes per exchange once the exchange is broken the attacker gains access to the session keys allowing them to decrypt all traffic  this issue can be fixed in the following ways   disable export-grade ciphers  use elliptic curve dh ecdhe rather than finite field dh this makes the attack much harder in practice due to the lesser advantage of precomputation  generate a unique dh group for a large prime size such as 2048-bit and use that instead of a default widely-shared group   as a side note one of the interesting factors in this bug is that it matches the nsa s reported capabilities in the field of tls and ike vpn traffic decryption in the case of mass traffic capture and decryption the precomputation attack becomes particularly efficient and effective due to the vast quantity of data available which is likely to be associated with a known shared prime  more details available    full paper    logjam pfs deployment guide    to prevent logjam you could follow recommendations of the  guide to deploying diffie-hellman for tls  which will help you to configure your server apache http server nginx iis lighttpd tomcat postfix sendmail dovecot haproxy openssh amazon elastic beanstalk    test if your server is safe  generate a strong and unique diffie-hellman group  deploy ecdhe cipher suites  disable export cipher suites    mozilla ssl configuration generator  is also a good configuration tool","tl;dr ssl/tl client server agre weak crypto well turn weak crypto weak detail ssl/tl protocol perform client send list support cipher suit server choos one end initi handshak messag exchang encrypted/protect newli negoti crypto algorithm content messag hash preced messag idea activ attackera mitm attack could try manipul list cipher suit sent client remov strong crypto suit keep weakest client server support howev would break messag thu messag meantamong role detect downgrad attack theori fine unless client server support cipher suit weak mitm attack break right away unravel whole crypto layer fix messag real-tim happen even detail use dhe cipher suitesa diffie-hellman ephemer server send dh parametersmodulu gener client server perform diffie-hellman key exchang furthermor server sign messag privat keyusu rsa key sinc everybodi use rsa practic client verifi signatureth public key one server certif proce dh paramet complet key exchang happen previou centuri rather strict u.s export regul crypto prompt export cipher suit i.e weak crypto compat regul mani ssl server still support export cipher suit particular cipher suit dhe mandat dh modulu 512-bit moreov ssl server modulu use one provid ssl librari easier gener reus modulu everybodi els big issu dh toler fine howev mean attack invest lot comput break one dh instanc use given modulu p attack reus almost work break instanc modulu p attack run attack mitm posit modifi data flow real-tim attack alter list cipher suit sent client specifi export dhe cipher suit server compli send 512-bit modulu p client still persuad non-export dhe dh modulu dh modulu client accept weak/export modulu server fine attack use pre-comput valu p break dh real-tim fix messag logjam articl author call protocol flaw messag contain export dh paramet tag export thu indistinguishablesav modulu length messag contain non-export dh paramet howev would say real flaw real problem client server accept 512-bit dh modulu even though know weak ?

121024,sse,3,0.342994213,attack-prevention|attacks|authentication|challenge-response,attack challenge/response authentication by requesting challenges,if a client/server application uses a challenge/response pattern for authentication e.g scram or alike it often involves the usage of nonces client nonce and server nonce for preventing replay attacks  the server will generate a server nonce based on a secure random generated number concatenated with the client nonce supposing that the server stores the most recent received client nonce and issued server nonce to guarantee that older or invalid nonces will not be accepted this would open an attack vector  an attacker could brute-force request challenges to userid s that he guesses in order to override the valid and agreed client/server nonce with a new value that the actual client doesn t know if this happens in between the actual client s challenge and response the server will deny access as the nonce will not be valid anymore which would be some kind of denial of service attack  if the server decides to only update the actually valid server/client nonce in storage only if the challenge/response was successfully executed as a whole it would need to decline challenge requests for users that have not responded to the most recent challenge this would also open an an attack window the attack could request challenges to guessed users in order to prevent them from requesting a challenge in the first place  assuming that the server will keep track of a list of unused nonces both attacks would be prevented but this opens another vector for the attacker to request huge amount of challenges leading the server to store all of those nonces in storage provoking i/o load and potentially leading to dos again  anyhow i am currently not understanding how to securely implement nonce handling on the server-side to prevent those dos attacks currently i have the feeling that one trades the protection against replay attacks in favour of dos  i know that there are other means to prevent this via request throttling on firewalls etc but i d like to solve this problem on the challenge/response implementation level if possible thanks for ideas and answers,the two concerns you ve raised are   the server s copy of the server nonce can be altered by an attacker who doesn t know the password  as the server s list of client nonces grows without bounds it can be used in a dos   a common technique is to time-limit the nonces say for m minutes for an appropriate m   for the first problem by time-limiting the nonces the server can maintain multiple authentication sessions with the client each one keeping track of it s own nonce this isn t a large resource drain on the server as these sessions are automatically deleted after m minutes   the second problem is resolved by time-restricting client nonces for this to work the client nonce must include a timestamp otherwise you re open to post-timeout replay attacks when the server cleans out its expired nonces thereby forgetting used nonces so the client s nonce should be   by including the timestamp in the nonce it ensures that the nonce cannot be used post-timeout  when determining the value of m it needs to be large enough to handle network communication times and clock differences between the server and the client m needs to be small enough to sufficiently lower your resource requirements m being 1 or even less than 1 may be appropriate if no user interaction is required during the authentication process if there s user input required a larger m will be needed  a well-resourced attacker may still be able to execute a dos upon you as there is still a window of m minutes for this to occur but this is a small window and would require a lot of attacker resources that is it would be a ddos and not a straight dos surviving ddos attacks are a problem of their own,two concern rais server copi server nonc alter

91641,sse,11,0.858916342,ddos|risk-management,ddos - security or operational risk,the chief security officer of a medium sized it company 400-500 employees recently released a bulletin in which he stated that ddos attacks are not a security risk but an operational one.also i was told that in a previous meeting he denied that ddos or related attacks are his responsibility  from my understanding security comprises three major themes  confidentiality integrity availability  in my opinion ddos attacks are clearly a security risk as they directly target availability of a service - and thus are also clearly within the responsibilities of a chief security officer so who is right?   are ddos attacks a security or operational risk,while i generally disagree with the cso i can see a reason why he drew this line  the question can come down to the delineation of who needs to lead mitigation and remediation efforts ddos does of course impact availability but is typically handled by the operations team if a ddos event happens your cso might feel that there is nothing that he can do and wants another party to take charge in other words don t call the cso at 2am when ddos is happening but call him at 2am when there is a breach  consider the scope of the cia triad should every cso be ultimately in charge of facility fire and safety systems in the server room? fires are also an availability risk but in some organizations that responsibility should fall to a facilities manager and not the cso although the cso should have a hand in this area too. in the similar situation as above if the fire alarm goes off at 2am call the facilities manager not the cso your cso might be drawing this kind of line to equate fires and ddos as the same kind of risk to the organization   that said it is also possible that a ddos event can be a distraction or leverage for a wider security attack so i believe that the cso does still need to be involved at some level   so strictly speaking you are correct in your assessment and i generally agree with you but it might come down to a different understanding of role definitions and available resources   from a technical 1s and 0s stand point he is correct but the accepted scope of security threats include availability however all companies are free to assign responsibilities as they see fit so your cso may be simply stating a point that it s not his responsibility to mitigate that particular risk   i think that is a false dichotomy and your cso is being plain silly     though i am fond of the silliness the security department should be driving risk mitigation squabbling over areas of responsibility are obviously not productive though it might fit into the general corporate culture     while there are various ways of qualifying the realm of security and their responsibility - the cia triad is one but there are others - a mature responsible cso would at the least be pushing for a solution     i have heard some say that the distinction between security risk and operational risk is whether there is a potential threat actor or merely accidental or misuse while this does make a lot of sense i think a more pragmatic approach would be to simply accept that there is substantial overlap between the two - and that just means there are more resources to work on the problem not that everybody gets to abdicate responsibility      that said - in this specific case the process i would recommend is having the cso or technical people in his department drive the mitigation procedure define a framework for levels of risk etc - and then hand it off to operations to implement a fitting solution perhaps the security folk can recommend a solution or maybe they should just define metrics that the solution should meet depending on how technical / hands-on the team is     in this way the company can handle the fact that while the risk is a security risk the solution is an operational one     ddos attacks fall into both operational and security categories because of the triad mentioned above however security personnel tend to be more knowledgeable of attacks so like avid said there should be communication between the security and it teams to solve the problem rather than losing hours covering research that could be solved by a 10 minute phone call   i would consider it to be both operationalor biz as well as a security risk   biz   businesses run on reputation and if the reputation goes for a toss as a result of a ddos attack if the c-level executives fails in the damage control area the situation is especially grave when you are running a b2b service   security   crackers can use the ddos attacks as part of  attention diversion  strategy to attack or find other vulnerable areas,think fals dichotomi cso plain silli though fond silli secur depart drive risk mitig squabbl area respons obvious product though might fit gener corpor cultur variou way qualifi realm secur respons - cia triad one other - matur respons cso would least push solut heard say distinct secur risk oper risk whether potenti threat actor mere accident misus make lot sens think pragmat approach would simpli accept substanti overlap two - mean resourc work problem everybodi get abdic respons said - specif case process would recommend cso technic peopl depart drive mitig procedur defin framework level risk etc - hand oper implement fit solut perhap secur folk recommend solut mayb defin metric solut meet depend technic / hands-on team way compani handl fact risk secur risk solut oper one,,ddos|attacks|vulnerability,3,25,823,0.030376671,15/06/2015 6:18,DH,Wants to know what form of risk DDOS attacks are,AT,Suggests how to better classify and handle the type of risk

getting onto it the drawback is that you won t be able to store anything on it from the college pc  i have a couple of questions here   are the files fine when in the lab?and only become  infected  when youmove them to your usb drive?  are you certain the usb stick is clean?  does the usb stick have software on it which is supposed to write files as exe s some versions do this if encryption is enabled   the reason i ask is that it could be an issue you are bringing to the lab  if not and the lab machines are infected there is nothing you can realistically do with your usb drive to combat this problem you would need to get the lab techs to sort out the issue at their end  some thoughts/steps for your situation... if i was the one to deal with the problem...   quick solution  backup your files format everything and reinstall do a clean installation update everything to the latest patches/hotfixes it will take less time than the other solution   the other solution.....   prepare/arm yourself with tools     antivirus live cds see  here   here  and  here   antirootkits  antimalware   panda usb vaccine  it s not an av it can be used with any antivirus you have see this  ms article  is you like the manual way better      the free panda usb vaccine can be used on individual usb drives to disable its autorun.inf file in order to prevent malware infections from spreading automatically when applied on a usb drive the vaccine permanently blocks an innocuous autorun.inf file preventing it from being read created deleted or modified once applied it effectivelly disables windows from automatically executing any malicious file that might be stored in that particular usb drive the drive can otherwise be used normally and files even malware copied to/from it but they will be prevented from opening automatically panda usb vaccine currently only works on fat &amp fat32 usb drives also keep in mind that usb drives that have been vaccinated cannot be reversed except with a format    scan-clean the pcs    remove ethernet cable cut off connectivity internet-or internal to the lab  reboot the computers from a  genuine  antivirus live cd see  here   here  and  here  for info don t download and run them unless you make sure they are valid/trusted/original/etc  use common sense  prepare your own from your av or contact your av vendor/reseller  if  you can t get/pay a av live cd do the following prepare  clean install  a laptop/pc with the av,antirootkit antimalware of your choice and put the infected hard drive as an external with a sata-ide to usb cable or as a slave harddrive i would choose the sata/ide to usb cable its cheap and fast scan again and again  update the virus definitions in memory or usb and scan the whole system   clean any infections  scan again the whole system  don t boot to normal os yet  check if you have still have infections  do the same with any live cd you have with antirootkit or antimalware capabilities some really bad malware/rootkits hide in the mbr and survive reboots or even after a good clean   boot your pc into  safe mode  if it s windows if you can t boot from a cd and repeat previous steps still a safe bet but you might not be able to get rid of some really bad malware/rootkits a dead system is allways easier to clean   reboot to your os only if you are pretty sure that u got no more infections don t connect to any network internet or lab yet    stop usb infection    use panda usb vaccine or see the ms article 5th link vaccinate your pc and all your usb you will disable your windows autorun/autoplay features and your usb will get a autorun.inf file it s blank a dummy one and even if you put it on an infected pc you might get the virus hidden exe,bat,scr..etc  but  your usb will not  automatically  infect other pcs unless you run the exe s on purpose  the usb drive will lose the vaccination only if you format it  remember that  make  visible  your hidden files and your protected/system files many viruses are marked as system files and get under the av radar apply that to all folders   use an av that auto scan any usb device kaspersky and free avira do exactly that maybe others as well    don t double click on the usb or cd-dvd icons from my computer  that way the default windows way the os see if the cd/dvd/usb has a autorun.inf file and if they have it it s executed and after that the contents are displayed a more safe way is to  press winkey+e windows explorer  and navigate to your drive from the left panel that way you tell the os to display just the contents even if your drive have an infected autorun.inf it doesn t autorun   update update update not only your operating system  but also your programs  !!!!!!    getting your files back after been infected and deleted by your av  - use  photorec  or any other undelete program you want/know/have you will also recover viruses so be careful  additional ideas    get a usb with write protection cheap solution    use a stand-alone laptop with 3 or more av as a scan-usb machine use only one av as a resident av and the others as on-demand otherwise you might have problems connect it to the internet only to update the av signatures for nothing else anything that you want to put inside you lab will be scanned first from that laptop with 3 avs another cheap solution    you might want to implement the previous idea to everything you download from the internet configure your lab so anything you download goes to a temp folder scanned from 3 avs one by one and if it passes the check then be available for you to get it our admin had it that way i think it was configured from the isa server i m not sure    install and endpoint protection system gfi endpoint security and symantec endpoint protection provides protections from unauthorized usb drives    search for hbgary inoculator from their site it s an enterprise appliance designed to detect remove and prevent windowsÂ® host re-infection of known malware without waiting for your antivirus vendor to provide a detection signature with its breakthrough digital antibody technology  inoculator provides a countermeasure against targeted cyber threats without disruption to your enterprise haven t tried it     i am curious to hear the progress/result from your lab... :p  if the lab s machines are infected there s not really anything you can do to protect yourself  you can t protect the usb pendrive by installing software on it  you can install antivirus software on your own computer so that if you plug the usb pendrive into your own computer your own computer won t be infected by the virus on the pendrive  good antivirus software will typically scan the entire pendrive when you insert it onto your computer or when you access files on the pendrive  however understand that this is a crummy stopgap and not to be recommended because it does nothing to prevent the files on your pendrive getting infected and because it is still pretty dangerous to carry around an infected pendrive you are potentially infecting anyone else s machine who you stick the pendrive into and anti-virus is not perfect and may miss some viruses  so this is not a good solution  the right solution is as others have suggested to contact the it department who administers the lab machines and get them to remove the spyware/malware on their machines and install proper antivirus software on the lab machines   the hidden files will be revealed  do delete the virus files though  i have had viruses infecting my computer through usb drives for a very long time then i found this hope this helps : http://techwikasta.com/2012/10/how-to-secure-your-usb-drive/   all antivirus software i have used handles scanning usb sticks  i posted answer to a similar question in  detecting malware-infected usb drives   the sum and substance is using a different secure computer without any autorun facility create and lock an  autorun.inf  file in the root of the usb stick if there is one there examine it for malware clues and get rid of it  i like using a mac for this because they read and write fat and exfat natively which are common on usb drives mac formats of course and also ntfs if enabled through third party software they also do not autorun and are immune to pc viruses macs also show all partitions even hidden ones on the

it also seems possible to do the internal scanning yourself if you have done the correct training  we had planned to have a setup webserver etc per client so that all their data etc would be completely siloed and allow customisation each client would have their own subdomain i m wondering now if that would require a penetration test per setup?  from the examples in the saq around penetration testing it seems that a new one must be done for what i would consider fairly small changes e.g updating the os how does this relate to the application level? will we be able to do new releases without having to do a new penetration test?  any advice on how a startup should approach this is appreciated of course i understand only a qsa can give the final word  update thanks for the responses i should ve read the  pci penetration testing guidance document  before posting this question from that document the scope of the system seems particularly important to get right,"it depends a lot on the specific companies you choose to use - there are some common terms but it is not unheard of to come across automated penetration testing or manual vulnerability scanning  in general a vulnerability scan is designed to look for common flaws it will detect out-of-date server software unpatched systems open ports which should be filtered and a few more specific flaws such as default usernames and passwords being used on publicly available systems it can also either take place externally where it looks at what is visible from the outside of your network usually a remote service hosted by the security company or internally where it looks at what can be seen from the perspective of a user on your network usually a pre-configured appliance which the security company provides and which you host on your network somewhere  on the other hand a penetration test tends to be more targeted looking specifically at your systems a tester will look at open ports and software on the systems they can see and work to abuse them this might include testing for things like sql injection or cross-site scripting issues or running brute force attacks against passwords or usernames these types of test can be more dangerous to the systems being tested so automated testing tends to err on the side of caution to prevent accidental outages pen testers are also more likely to pick up on logical errors where the application does something that it shouldn t can you buy goods without paying? can you change your user privileges? which automated vulnerability testing won t detect  internal and external scanning for pen testing is usually the same as mentioned above - internal tests look at the system from the point of view of a device connected to the internal network and often find issues which could be exploited by malicious activity by company staff external tests are more like standard attacks by malicious third parties  both are very useful tools and can be used in conjunction very well - have an initial vulnerability scan to pick up on any low hanging fruit fix those then have a penetration test which is likely to pick up on any more difficult issues by sorting the low hanging fruit the penetration testers will have more time to look at the more specialist parts of your system - they have to report the simple stuff if it s there then have a regular scheduled vulnerability scan to ensure any new deployments don t have issues you can get a penetration test for  new systems too if you like or if there are major changes to your code or systems but assuming you make use of a secure development life cycle you shouldn t need to test every little change unless you re in a business area with high levels of compliance e.g banking applications are often tested after even minor changes     i m not clear on where the border is between internal and external for example does external include a logged in user?   internal penetration testing is done within your network itself external penetration testing would be outside of that  it does not really consider a users authentication status only network layout     we had planned to have a setup webserver etc per client so that all their data etc would be completely siloed and allow customisation each client would have their own subdomain i m wondering now if that would require a penetration test per setup?   in your setup where the payment page is hosted in an iframe pci-dss only applies to the  critical systems  ie the actual websites that host the iframe based payment page while your pci-dss compliance exposure is reduced in the scenario you do still have to attest to compliance but on a more limited basis if architected correctly your app servers would not fall under pci-dss scope  unless you really need to host the payment page you could actually outsource that website to a 3rd party hosting service and monitor their own pci-dss compliance see  pci penetration testing guidance section 2.2.1  this would remove the requirement for you to manage penetration testing completely again if architected to isolate these iframe payment servers to a pci-compliant 3rd party you could  legitimately bypass your own pci-dss compliance requirement completely   if for technical or other reasons you need to host that page then again your penetration testing scope is limited to those critical systems   though you may want to do penetration testing on your actual application servers hopefully you can bypass the pci-dss requirement and cost by clearly dividing the app and payment servers in your network     from the examples in the saq around penetration testing it seems that a new one must be done for what i would consider fairly small changes e.g updating the os how does this relate to the application level? will we be able to do new releases without having to do a new penetration test?   the above penetration testing guidance document also spells out what is considered a  significant change  of a designated critical system section 2.6 page 8 it is up to you to consider the impact of a configuration change per your environment and processes assuming you have isolated card holder data from your app servers you can isolate your releases from your pci-dss compliance scope  see also  pci dss e-commerce guidelines  page 22 for roles and responsibilities under an iframe based ecommerce setup     we had planned to have a setup webserver etc per client so that all  their data etc would be completely siloed and allow customisation,  each client would have their own subdomain i m wondering now if that  would require a penetration test per setup?   this would require both internal and external vulnerability scans but not necessary penetration testing the external vulnerability scan  must  be done by an asv and should include  all  external ips and domains in scope the internal vulnerability scan should include all internal private ips and should be done by an internal qualified resource or by an external company specialising in security  as  per the guidance  the penetration testing can be done in a pre-release environment page 7 states     2.3.4 separate testing environment      because of the nature and the intent of penetration testing such testing in a production  environment during normal business hours may impact business  operations and attempts to avoid disruption may increase the time,  resources and complexity of the testing this is especially important  for high availability systems that may be impacted by penetration  testing in a production environment to avoid disruptions and to speed  up testing a separate environment that is identical to the production  environment may be used for testing instead of the production  environment the penetration tester would need to ensure the same  application and network-layer controls as production exist in the  testing environment this may be accomplished through methods to map  out the production environment to verify it matches the testing  environment this should be included in the rules of engagement all  exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be  corrected on production systems and testing repeated to verify that  security weaknesses have been addressed   so as long as each customer environment mirrors the pre-release environment where your pen-testing took place i would expect this would be sufficient  yes you should provide logins this way the tester can ensure that permissions have been appropriately setup for each of your documented access levels  in addition to the above remember that all custom code should have some type of security assessment pci dss 6.6     for public-facing web applications address new threats and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and ensure these applications are  protected against known attacks by either of the following methods EEEEEEEEEE°         reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated  application vulnerability security assessment tools or",clear border intern extern exampl extern includ log user?

well the hacker had an 0day exploit in the piece of technology and he wanted to attack organization b    secondary route/bridging exploitation an extended dos attack that can be sustained can force business units within the organization to move to secondary systems paths networks to keep critical business going while some of these secondary paths may be well-planned and secured many are not for instance a business unit may stand up a wifi or mifi device and start using it as their business network without any security infrastructure if an attacker is actively monitoring and profiling they may be able to capture and attack these very vulnerable paths and now you have a direct totally unsecured bridged network into the organizations intranet    i don t believe dos attacks are traditionally utilized to gain access to the system per se  it is more of a tool utilized to confuse the system or flood the system with irrelevant requests and deny legitmate traffic access to the system  that can in turn facilitate the use of vulnerability exploits to actually gain access to the system   denial-of-service attacks by definition is simply denying authorized users or devices access to the specific system or network  it could be utilized in conjunction with another exploit say a buffer overflow to get the required result of penetrating the system   also the dos attack can thwart it pros and security pros from focusing on the real issue at hand is that someone is exploiting their system  a lot of pressure is placed on the it department by senior management when they can not get to or access certain pieces of technology  so while they are attempting to fix and resolve the dos issue the hacker goes by completely obscured  additionally trying to sift through the plethora of log files that will have been created while it was going on leads to a difficulty in tracking a breach has ever occured    there s a perfect illustration in  this movie  and an even better in  that movie     spoiler alert  although if you have not seen these movies yet then you must have spent the last three decades frozen in a glacier or whatev  in the first movie the bad guys simulate a terrorist attack which can be thought of a  massive dos  so that the authorities apply their anti-terrorist procedures which imply shutting down power -- which automatically opens the strong room that the bad guys wanted to enter in the first place  in the other one the newer bad guys simulate another terrorist attack this time with actual bombing there is nothing more dosing than high explosives because then the whole anti-terrorism scheme allocates all police forces to a bomb-seeking race that s one effect of dos to divert defence resources from their normal stations  and  the explosion itself overwhelms vibration detectors in the bank which is the true target of the villains -- who can then make a big hole in the strong room wall with bulldozers undetected by the said detectors  in a network+computers environment you can think of a dos as triggering abnormal conditions under which normal defence mechanisms are less effective  a dos attack can crash the server causing it to reboot and execute assets that the attacker previously compromised  for example the attacker compromised the cron table or a script called by cron when the server reboots the corrupted cron is invoked  could even take the ddos to a whole new level if the corrupted script  overruns the drive partition   a dos attack may force a system s ips to fail open the traffic towards internal recources that is a configuration option on many defence in depth appliances and overwhelming them will lead to either service unavailability or degradation of security if the service availability of the organization is more improtant than the security of the data provided by the service the system is configured to fail open meaning that security will be degraded by accepting all connections,dos attack use sever way part gain access overwhelm primari defens conduct dos attack primari defens mechan get caught overwhelm result may respond appropri b hang altogeth c watcher watch distract effort lost dos log addit primari system roll secondari system often happen may up-to-d configur could catch roll-ov time-gap wherebi synchron everyth current overwhelm primari system may expos flaw dos attack may use expos flaw could exploit could procedur flaw could system flaw could result dos attack forc organ upgrad upgrad take window opportun exploit dos attack decoy classic attack.. magician time watch left hand steal right dos much focu organ secondari rout system physic social technic could underman provis system easili by-pass without notic dos attack could plant heard hacker conduct limit dos attack organ done research cio organ close organ b organ gener busi arena suspect could get organ adopt specif technolog thwart rather crude dos attack organ b would - think might next correct organ b why?

only nobody has unlimited time and resources but with more time and resources more backdoors can be found i.e the ability of detecting backdoors is related to the amount of money one can throw at the problem only the ones who have a lot of money are usually also the ones who are most likely to get attacked with the more advanced and hard to find backdoors since the purpose of the backdoors is ultimately to get a high return on investment - and the more money or equivalent information data... are there the more attractive the target is  backdoors might be explicitly added or just happen i.e bugs at lots of places like in the firmware of network cards cpu graphic card usb controllers printers ..  in mainstream software like windows or other os office browser extensions some arbitrary software downloaded from the internet ..  backdoors might also exist at the hardware level like a specific sequence of cpu instructions might switch off memory protection or similar or side channels like meltdown allow reading over memory protection barriers  in order to fully protect against backdoors one must either be aware of all possible backdoors and how they work or one must be sure that no backdoor exists at all this means that one must either create all hardware firmware and software oneself and never make a serious bug or one need to get these things from vendors one can fully trust i.e 100.00% -  99.99% is not enough to never add an explicit backdoor and to never add serious bugs even if one will find such vendors unlikely these usually need to rely on other vendors and there the trust problem is the same  the best strategy against backdoors is probably to assume that there will always be some backdoor or bug the goal is then to make sure that there are as few backdoors/bugs as possible and to make sure that their impact will be as low as possible this means to buy only from really trustable vendors where one can also mostly trust their delivery chain but also to add resilience against possible backdoors/bugs in strategic places this might for example be a strict firewall which only allows connections to a few places or this might be use of ipsec or similar inside the local lan since one does not fully trust switches and routers and physical network cards this means also to isolate different parts of the network from each other but also isolation at the application level sandboxes containers privilege segmentation techniques... or the os level microkernel this means also to use only the really necessary software and hardware etc the simpler and the stricter defined an environment is the easier it can be audited for possible vulnerabilities and the better possible attack vectors can be determined and addressed,realli sure ask look mainli complain fuzzi answer get regard backdoor get clear yes|no answer kind backdoor found found simpl first backdoor sound deliber ad mani backdoor system probabl result inadvert ad bug use backdoor knowledg attack cours backdoor done help insid user employ phish mail similar theori backdoors/bug found given unlimit time resourc -

 note     the purpose of this question is mainly educational/theoretical so mitigation steps required however few there are other than installing an av are preferred    all attacks would be through the network there is no transfer of physical media between the infected computer and the to-be-protected one you can further assume that there is no shared storage nas etc nor are there any shared folders shared credentials user-groups rdp/vnc etc on any of the computers    however other than the above no further hardening steps have been taken    the primary concern is data-theft in case that matters or if it can help narrow down the scope of the question    this question is intentionally limited to windows 7 so as to limit the scope of the answers and to provide some further limiting pre-existing conditions folder-sharing and rdp disabled however if the essential nature of in-network pc-to-pc threats do not vary much then a platform-neutral answer will also be appreciated    if the question is still too broad i d appreciate being pointed in the direction of an informative if technical guide or even a starting point for getting such technical / detailed guides,security is a process where new software bugs are discovered from time to time sometimes by good people and sometimes by bad people  software bugs can be discovered in both user software like excel but also in os network stack windows 7 is based on rather well tested code in which  hundreds  of remote vulnerabilities were found and patched during last 15-20 years but still it s theoretically possible that someone will break into your system just by exploiting vulnerable os  just read some security articles from 90-ties about any os to image what i m writing about  but calm down nowadays difficulty level to break in on secured well configured will current security patches applied installed antivirus and firewall turned on computer is rather high so don t panic and instead just check if your computer is secured as i mentioned above  there are a few possible scenarios even after assuming man in the middle is not happening   missing patches   if your system is missing a patch that allows rce that is an easy win there are plenty of  remote exploits that exist  and new ones every so often mitigation patch your system!   are you on a domain?

157946,sse,9,0.332105845,injection,injection of code into executable - size question,code injection  is the process of injecting some malicious code into a legitimate binary  a lot of code injection projects that i have seen involve finding a large area of null bytes   in the   section of the binary in order to inject shellcode then the address of the entry point is changed in order to point to the injected shellcode the injected shell code will then point to the beginning of the original code after finishing  sometimes  there are not enough contiguous \x00 bytes available  in the   section in order to perform this action as a result the project will not be able to perform code injection   why don t they just increase the size of the .text section segment?  is it because of security reasons,if i am reading your question correctly it all depends on the code of the binary not the size of the .text section  have you read how a buffer overflow works? the reason for the padding is to get to a point that the code will return or execute your desired shellcode or address  expanding the .text section would not do anything  it s all about putting the proper input guards in place so that the malicious injection/ user input will not allow for this type of attack  binary modification is a complex subject and requires some understanding of the system s  application binary interface abi   process layout in virtual memory  the  runtime environment  and the  compilation   process  background information will be discussed here in order to provide context for the answer to the question  1 code injection vs static binary modification patching  from the question     code injection into binary is the process of injecting some malicious code into a legitimate binary      a lot of code injection projects that i have seen will find a large   into   section in order to inject their shellcode they then change the address of the entry point in order to point to the injected shellcode the injected shell code will then point to the beginning of the original code after finishing    code injection usually refers to code included in input entered at program runtime which differs from the process described above in which a binary is statically modified prior to program execution in order to alter its runtime behavior  from  mitre s common weakness enumeration cwe entry regarding code injection  emphasis mine      description summary       the software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment       extended description       when software allows a user s input to contain code syntax it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the software such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution      injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways for this reason the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses the most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e they allow for  the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane this means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels using no other mechanism  while buffer overflows and many other flaws involve the use of some further issue to gain execution injection problems need only for the data to be parsed the most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are sql injection and format string vulnerabilities   one implication here is that code injection is a technique employed at program runtime in order to alter program behavior a second implication is that code injection includes executable code in input whose origin is external to the binary itself and code injection does not alter the structure of the binary   altering the structure of an executable binary prior to execution can be referred to as  static binary instrumentation  but is more commonly referred to as   patching    from  pebil efficient static binary instrumentation for linux  emphasis mine     there are two main approaches to binary instrumentation static and dynamic  static binary instrumentation inserts additional code and data into an executable and generates a persistent modified executable  whereas the dynamic instrumentation inserts additional code and data during execution without making any permanent modifications to the executable    the distinction between runtime process modification and static modification is important because their technical implications are quite different   2 sections segments linking and relocation  from the question     sometimes there is not enough available   bytes into the   section in order to perform this action so the project will not be able to perform that injection      why don t they just increase the size of the .text section segment?   there is an important distinction between sections and segments in elf binaries        sections  hold the bulk of object file information for the linking  view instructions data symbol table relocation information and so on  1       sections and their associated information are used by     to perform  relocation and symbol resolution    segments and their associated information are used by the  program loader in the kernel  to map portions of the binary file on disk into virtual memory at the correct offsets   here is a diagram from the system v abi contrasting sections with segments:        object files participate in program linking building a program and program execution running a program for convenience and efficiency the object file format provides parallel views of a fileEEEEEEs contents reflecting the differing needs of these activities  1     why does this matter?

13464,sse,11,0.545966744,ddos|dns|webserver,why do ddos attacks cost a fortune to stop,i have read so many stories that a major ddos attack is causing companies thousands of dollars to mitigate i have two questions    is this because they try to keep the servers accessible to real site visitors while an attack is going on?    does shutting the server down instead of trying to keep it up still cause loss of money? in other words instead of spending thousands of dollars to try to keep the server up why not just shut it down concede from the attackers and spend nothing,it s because if you shut a server down you can t use it for revenue imagine having a real shop if you close it during the day you can t sell anything and offer your services it s as simple as that  to improve my answer it costs a lot to fight because it s pretty much impossible to defend yourself against such attacks since the attacker can use a very large number of machines to attack you if you can defend yourself from an attack by 1000 computers the attacker only needs to add one more to win and since there is no limit to the number of machines the attacker can use you basically will never be invulnerable :  so in conclusion shutting the server down means no revenue because you can t offer your services anymore but at the same time keeping it up is extremely expensive but it s better than shutting it down  another aspect to the cost for a company besides lost revenue is the cost of investigating verifying and responding to such attacks there are conversations with isps combing through log files re-writing firewall rules communicating with customers then postmortems  but note that a company cannot  stop  the attack they can only weather it  stopping  and attack would require isp cooperation and coordinated action   ** correction as a result of comments **  i had said that there were large costs to an isp to stop a ddos attack but i was working from old experience with isps given the premise that an isp can stop an attack with great effectiveness and little cost it seems the only cost to a company is the lost revenue and market opportunity of having an unavailable asset as well as the costs of incident response  it s this simple if the ddos attack causes you to shut down whether by the damage it does directly or by your response to it then the attacker succeeds if an attack succeeds it will be performed every time the attacker wants to succeed  the way to reduce ddos attacks is to make sure they  fail  if a ddos attack doesn t take the site down there s no point in attacking  so to prevent ddos attacks you need to be able to survive them     in other words instead of spending thousands of dollars to try to keep the server up why not just shut it down concede from the attackers and spend nothing   because then you will have to cave in to the attackers every time they want something  here s a real-world scenario from the time of unrest in bosnia  you operate a chat service that is open to all comers you also host events for several major companies such as chats with celebrities  some racists from a particular country close to the unrest in bosnia don t like certain channels that speak a language associated with a race they dislike they demand you prohibit users from that country and close those chat channels that speak in that language if you don t do what they ask they will ddos you during every event you host on your service and cause you to lose those major customers to competitors  what do you do? and if you cave in to the threats how do you explain that to your users?  you want to know what they actually did? they multiplied their server capacity by 10 and their internet bandwidth by 20 they added a full-time ddos person just to monitor and react to attacks they spent a lot of money but they were able to issue some choice words of resistance to the racists it was money well spent  you can also combat ddos attacks by blocking the traffic  before  it gets to your server this can be a very cost effective solution this is the idea that  cloudflare  is based on but there are other similar solutions both commercial and do-it-yourself  the cost of a ddos has mostly to do with lost of revenues not fixing the problem per se    i truly don t mean to dumb down the answer you probably understood all this by now but as an analogy consider you have a brick and mortar store one morning your store gets filled with non-buying customers with a crowd in front of the door making it seem as if the store is not accessible furthermore not only is the store not available for  real business    the crowd has planted a huge sign on the front door that says  closed      this would look really awful for customers passing by and they would go elsewhere  shutting the server down to stop ddos is like killing a patient to cure a disease this is not stopping the attack this is actually making it succeed by doing the damage yourself   remember the end goal of ddos is server shutdown..    stopping  ddos means handling the attack without interrupting regular website activities  if you close your website for every ddos attack or even for every major one you`ll be out of business in a week as the attackers will keep coming back again and again and again  until you either pay-up of setup a defensive perimeter,shut server revenu imagin real shop close day sell anyth offer servic simpl improv answer cost lot fight pretti much imposs defend attack sinc attack larg number machin attack defend attack 1000 comput attack need add one win sinc limit number machin attack basic never invulner : conclus shut server mean revenu offer servic anymor time keep extrem expens better shut,,ddos|attacks|vulnerability,3,48,975,0.049230769,4/4/2012 14:14,DH,Wants to know why DDoS prevention is so expensive,Ex,Explains why

if so what responses are appropriate and legal? are there any examples good or bad of this happening in the wild,"passive scanning such as determining geo location ip address network routes is probably a good idea to give you an understanding of where attacks are originating from  update actually for larger institutions this is kind of essential in determining whether the attack is a large scale organised attack or simply a lone hacker testing out the defences either way it will probably be distributed in either case it will provide useful information for further locking down the firewalls  depending on the legal framework of the country you live in retaliating to an attack with a active network attack of your own such as dos or virus would constitute an illegal act  a related response could be to set-up a honey trap to attract attackers and make them think they succeeded let them waste time and effort while you trace them maybe although that sounds like a bad script from a hollywood film   fighting back is what the cool kids do!  >:  regarding law i grabbed this snippet from  http://lawmeme.law.yale.edu/static/pastevents/digitalcops/papers/karnow_newcops.pdf  2005     conclusion  even under nuisance law not every counterstrike ûû or  ûûself helpûû effort ûû is automatically immune it has to be  reasonable and proportional to the nuisance issues i discussed  in connection with a similar requirement under self-defense.  and as always the light cast by ancient doctrine upon novel  technologies will produce illumination and shadow both courts  will ûûfudgeûû on the analysis and struggle for precedent,  sometimes testing out the wrong one just as no one wants to  roll out version 1 new software no one wants to be a test case  in court it is as a surgeon might say when considering a  complex multi-organ transplant an interesting case ûû not  something the patient likes to hear   on a serious note there are so many bad hack-back scenarios to imagine that you have to wonder when you would be ready to pull the trigger for example what if you hack-back to stop a botnet attack only to later learn that some of the systems you counter-attacked were critical hospital system that were inadvertently part of the botnet herd    regarding examples richard bejtlich  blogged  in 2005      i disagree with the strike-back idea as i believe it steps over the line into vigilante justices it is telling that tim s papers all pre-date the welchia worm which demonstrated how dangerous strike-back can really be you ll remember the devastating icmp traffic caused by welchia as it searched for live machines for purposes of disabling the blaster worm    an interesting case in the netherlands is appropriate here  the dutch police klpd brought down some servers that run a big botnet they deemed it legal to use the botnet now to send a message to the owners of the machines to inform them that they are infected  there is some discussion about whether it was actually legal but i think most people agree it s an ethical thing to do  this case is quite different from what you as a company would face but if this is already questioned as being not legal when done by the police one should wonder whether any action towards the attacker can be taken at all  another point to take into account is how the badguys can subvert your counter-attack    for example they can send malicious packets with spoofed ip addresses  knowing  you will detect this and in retaliation attack the source of the attack - or actually the innocent server that is  actually  registered at the spoofed ip    thus they are using   you   to attack their victim the spoofed 3rd party    don t forget the attacked company will now believe - correctly - that your servers are attacking theirs never mind that you believed that you had just cause to do so - that is irrelevant point of fact that you are  actively  attacking them and they will have reason to press charges or whatever    an interesting scenario would be if the 3rd party victim is  also  configured to counter-attack then of course you will be receiving actual attacks from their server - this time for real but of course that was your fault wasnt it?    both sides would probably dos each other before real harm was done.. unless they both choose to escalate and scale out.. they could bring down the whole intertubes!  the #1 question for me is what do you hope to achieve in fighting back?    if i get stung by a mosquito i ll kill it but if it gets away i won t chase it across the field  if i get attacked by a swarm of bees defending their hive i won t swat them - i ll protect myself by running away  the dangers of fighting back are well presented in the other answers but i ll repeat them   legality - your reaction might be illegal  collateral damage / joe jobs - your reaction harms a relatively innocent 3rd party   my personal choice of reactions   try to keep a decent level of security on my site so attacks have a reduced chance of success  gather info about attacks to assess the severity  potentially block the ip or if it s a bandwidth flood attack try to get my isp to block the ips  note that this will likely block non-malicious traffic to your site too collateral damage but most of the damage will be to you reduce traffic / access rather than to some 3rd party   hack-back also leads to a new type of attack kallisti  joe jobs spoof the source of attack to trick defenders into attacking the spoofed source  the kallisti attack would try to cause a hack-back loop between 2 or more sites either to create noise in which to hide the real attack or just to cause chaos  hail eris  the answer is pretty certainly no don t do it  i can imagine a scenario where a worm is attacking you and because you know that the worm spreads via vulnerability x you know that all computers that are attacking you have vulnerability x it may be possible for you to use vulnerability x to access the infected computers and warn their users or even shut them down  while you might think this is a morally acceptable thing to do it s very dangerous ground what if something you do goes wrong e.g leading to data loss that wasn t caused by the worm or you anger the original worm creator who then wants to retaliate against you in another way it s likely to be illegal in most jurisdictions as well   is it ever appropriate to become a criminal and put yourself your organization and your entire livelihood in jeopardy of legal action?

37362,sse,10,0.542226791,javascript|terminology|xss,why is the samy worm considered xss,last night i was browsing notable computer attacks and came across the  samy worm  which apparently affected a huge portion of the myspace network -- over one million users in under 24 hours according to  the perpetrator s story   on his website he offers a  step-by-step look at how he developed the code as well as the full source  i spent last night de-obfuscating it and looking at it to see how it worked what i don t understand is why it s classified as an xss attack? nothing in the code is changing the origin or injecting code from another website into myspace everything is happening directly with myspace urls  can someone explain this to me? also if you can explain what the purpose of   is that would be an awesome bonus.  the code more properly formatted is below,xss doesn t necessarily have to be from one site to another  it simply means that user input is able to be used in such a way that it updates content of the site to make it compromised and try to attack those entering the site  it uses the trust of the victim website to get the victim users to run it  in this case he was able to submit information to myspace that made people s myspace get updated with the worm which in turn posted the worm in to their content  if myspace had had better protection against xss then it shouldn t have been possible for the worm to be hosted by entry in the profile  xss has a weird name you don t need multiple websites for it  xss essentially the html equivalent of sql-injection when a website outputs some attacker controlled text into a html document without encoding entities like     or   the attacker can inject hostile javascript into the html document which will run in the context of that document  if you think of it as html-injection or javacript-injection it becomes much clearer what it is  xss has always been a misnomer it really should have always been called html injection or web page markup injection or web page script injection  one of the main potential results of script injection is indeed arbitrary cross-site scripting which really just means cross-domain scripting but of course web application worms of this nature stay entirely within their own domain  i can not explain but here is the link to the blog via wayback machine with a technical explanation of myspace worm   https://web.archive.org/web/20051016001131/http://namb.la/popular/tech.html   text from a blog in case you want to read it here  actually let s talk more about the problems encountered workarounds and how it worked in general  1 myspace blocks a lot of tags in fact they only seem to allow  ...maybe a few others   s i think they wouldn t allow  s  s       with   etc...however some browsers ie some versions of safari others allow   within   tags we needed   to get any of this to even work   example     2 we couldn t use quotes within the div because we had already used up single quotes and double quotes already this made coding js very difficult in order to get around it we used an expression to store the js and then executed it by name   example       3 sweet! now we can do javascript with single quotes however myspace strips out the word javascript from anywhere to get around this some browsers will actually interpret   as   that s     example     4 okay while we do have single quotes working we sometimes need double-quotes we ll just escape quotes e.g   myspace got me...they strip out all escaped quotes whether single or double however we can just convert   to   in javascript to actually produce the quotes   example     5 in order to post the code to the user s profile who is viewing it we need to actually get the source of the page.ah we can use   in order to get the page source which includes in only one spot the id of the user viewing the page myspace gets me again and strips out the word   anywhere to avoid this we use an   to evaluate two strings and put them together to form     example     6 time to actually access other pages we would use   but usually even when hidden   aren t as useful and are more obvious to the user that something else is going on so we use xml-http in order for the actual client to make http gets and posts to pages however myspace strips out the word   which is necessary for xml-http requests again we can use an eval to evade this another plus to xml-http is that the necessary cookies required to perform actions on myspace are passed along without any hassle   example     7 time to perform a get on the user s profile so that we can get their current list of heroes we don t want to remove any heroes we just want to append myself to their pre-existing list of heroes if we get their profile we can grab their heroes and store it for later with all the above figured out this is simple with an xml-http request except that we have to get the friend id of the actual user viewing a profile like we said above we can do this by grabbing the source of the page we re on however now we need to perform a search on the page for a specific word to find it so we perform this search however if we do this we may end up finding our actual code since it contains the same exact word we re looking for...because saying if this page contains  foo  do this that will always return true because it can always find foo within the actual code that does the searching another eval with a combination of strings avoids this problem   example     8 at this point we have a list of heroes first let s add me as a friend by performing an xml-http post on the addfriends page oh no this doesn t work! why not? we re on profile.myspace.com however the posting needs to be done on www.myspace.com no big deal however xml-http won t allow gets/posts to sites with a different domain name to get around this let s actually go to the same url but on www.myspace.com you can still view profiles from www.myspace.com so reloading the page on the domain we want to be on allows us to do the post   example     9 finally we can do a post! however when we send the post it never actually adds a friend why not? myspace generates a random hash on a pre-post page for example the are you sure you want to add this user as a friend page if this hash is not passed along with the post the post is not successful to get around this we mimic a browser and send a get to the page right before adding the user parse the source for the hash then perform the post while passing the hash  10 once the post is complete we also want to add a hero and the actual code the code will end up going into the same place where the hero goes so we ll only need one post for this   however we need to pre-get a page in order to get a new hash but first we have to actually reproduce the code that we want to post the easiest way to do this is to actually grab the source of the profile we re on parse out the code and then post this works except now all sorts of things are garbled! ah we need to url-encode/escape the actual code in order to post it properly   weird still doesn t work apparently javascript s url-encoding and escape function doesn t escape everything necessary so we ll need to manually do some replacing here in order to get the necessary data escaped we add a little but most of all samy is my hero to the mix append all the code right after and voila we have self-reproducing code a worm if you will  11 other limits such as a maximum length imposed other problems and required tight code no spaces obfuscated names reusable functions etc.  there were a few other complications and things to get around this was not by any means a straight forward process and none of this was meant to cause any damage or piss anyone off this was in the interest of..interest it was interesting and fun!

   causing overheating by blocking fans this works only when the fan speed is controlled from the motherboard itself however hardware which allows for a variable fan rotation speed also includes thermometers and safety circuits which forcibly cut off power in case of overheating  before  permanent damage occurs  though i know of a motherboard that did melt an ethernet card once the chip turned completely black and the plastic partially collapsed strangely enough the motherboard was fine afterwards    laptop batteries  can be permanently damaged  from software    however wanton destruction is often deemed useless by virus writers who now prefer silently installation and remote control modern virus try hard  not  to damage the computer  while some of you are somewhat correct in what you re saying i would say you re all a bit off an advanced worm could actually exploit one s computer at the hardware level and hack into and reprogram plc s programmable logic controllers one could exploit and utilize plc s to absolutely cause a fan speeds to go off the charts or to stop them and effectively destroy vital components/chipsets it has been done before many times i forgot the name of the worm but a worm had infiltrated and exploited very specific computers in iran i believe it was iran which had effectively messed up their whole nuclear program at least for awhile by infecting plc s to cause turbines to spin at an extreme frequency to totally mess the program up i suppose we all know who did this.. probably either the us s cia or nsa or another clandestine agency sent in to spy on the specs of their systems and therefore launch an effective worm to destroy or at least set back their nuclear program for quite a while   this is all very well documented and it does and can happen to anyone if one may correct me if i may be wrong about the specific worm worm s are like viruses except they actually are designed to automatically find and exploit a system it has found to be vulnerable i believe the name of this worm i may be wrong to be called stuxnet but it essentially exploits vulnerabilities on a system mainframes/servers and uses whatever means it has at its disposal ai usually to do whatever the writers designed it to exploit and do sabotage and acting as and being a sort of botnet which spreads through exploitation of exposed/vulnerable targets some of these types of worms are very dangerous even in the real-world. from grabbing cc s and bank account info even along with completely messing systems up. to sabotage or serve some selfish agendas    in short a worm or virus designed to sabotage systems is a very very real threat and they always have been   yes did this by accident it was actually an attempt at an ai essentially it overwrote the spd serial presence detect chips which on this model of laptop were write enabled instead of read only guess what. trashed! it initially failed bootup with a cryptic message about scd error and requiring f1 to fix then about a month later gave up completely acer 5730 series core 2 duo t7300 with a test on another machine wiping out the lcd id chip.i think it might have also corrupted the hard drive as well hard to fix secondary damage like this but the memory and bios were ruined.also found that the ram chips themselves were ok i determined this by testing them in another machine and they worked fine after reflashing with a copy of the original saved spd data though windows 7 x64 wouldn t run at all  if anyone else runs into this problem its worth checking if its got 1 or 2gb 10600s ecoram sticks as these seem to be problematical.i swapped out these for single 4gb in all my machines and this helped a lot with reliability.a lot of early laptops would not work at all initially with 4gb but later did when the bios was patched presumably so the manufacturers could test them  isn t this largely based on the device being affected? if the virus affects a car and grants access to brakes or steering then certainly it could cause large amounts of physical damage  unsure with recent video cards but some older were known to burn to flame or explode when too much overclocked but i cannot remember whether the overclocking only required a software operation what a virus can do or some changes on hardware switches..  these are some of the things that have been done with malicious code and some things that could be done    hard drive trashing - constantly moving that arm until death  over voltage - with software based overclocking it s not hard to up voltage until ram or cpu damage occurs  motherboards step voltage down to work with these components  many modern boards with overclocking functions allow for this to be manipulated from the os  pushing 2.3 volts into ddr2 will kill it  pushing 2 volts into ddr3 can kill it  the cpus can be damaged the same way  i assume some video cards can also be damaged this way   fan speed manipulation - stopping or slowing fans until over heating occurs  this can be coupled with disabling temperature fail safes  i haven t heard of a situation that you can over spin a fan  unless your cranking the voltage up higher than what the psu puts out i don t see it as a possibility specialized hardware would need to be implemented to over volt beyond the max input voltage  i also haven t seen any fans not rated for the same voltage the psu puts out  i m sure there is some higher voltage server equipment out there but even then i expect that voltage to be throttled down before it ever hit the hardware in a system   consistent overloading a psu with stress  a under rated psu will run hotter under a heavy load eventually leading the internal components to fail  this is typically capacitors  motherboard bios with flashing capabilities from the os a bios with malicious code could be flashed  it s also possible to flash a bios and force a thermal shutdown by stopping the fans  this would leave the bios in a half flashed or corrupted state making the board useless until repaired    when it comes to damaging electronics there is really only a handful of ways to do it  you either cook it with heat burn it up with electricity wear moving parts out or continuously shock the components until they are dead  yes it is quite possible by understanding the structure of the working board only then we can link ram to our desire like overload over voltage disturb timings manipulate functions like read memory 000001 to 001000 if it happens the ram will definitely be destroyed if that doesn t have a heat sink or fan some modern ram has that feature nowadays but still can be damaged by any software  program example   so now we know the basic interpretation so lets suppose that we have a ddr3 1333mhz ram so the code would be    don t ask me anything about how to write that or full source code this is for informational purposes only i won t tell you any c or function coding,older time viru could damag hardwar follow way play video signal rate exceed toler rang crt monitor post-1995 crt monitor includ safeti mechan lcd panel inher protect older monitor die way reflash bio perman kill hardwar resurrect hard e.g motherboard reflash junk flash read bio from.. floppi disk floppi disk nowaday ?

119165,sse,11,0.419511139,apache|malware|url-redirection,one-time mystery redirect from one of our pages,i ll make the explanation of the situation as thorough as i can and the question is at the bottom  recently we received a report from one of our users that immediately after logging out of our application he was suddenly redirected to a malware site  there was activity in the address bar and was forwarded in succession to two subsequent malware sites as seen in his history the final site he landed on was one of those pages that displays the obviously false claim that your computer has been compromised and gives you a number to call  i have the two urls in question but i won t post them here as they re obviously nefarious  anyway this leaves us with the puzzling question of what happened the way i see it there are two options   the user s computer an apple with no anti-virus software is compromised  our server did the redirect   the user said that he had the same issue a long time ago but nothing like this recently this is the first time in a long time that something like this has happened and it only happened the one time on our site it s tough to know if the issue the user had actually is the same issue as now  this is the first and so far only report of this nature that we have had   some of the checks i did were   i checked the code in the area of the application relating to the action he performed and there seemed to be nothing amiss   i looked at the source of the website just before performing the last action the user did to see if there was any odd javascript it all checked out  i checked the live version of the application against an older repository and nothing out of the ordinary  i grepped the entire web directory looking for headers php eval statements header calls and base_64_decodes possible php redirects and the actual malware urls and found nothing suspicious  i searched all the apache config files for any suspicious redirects and didn t find anything   i ve also tried repeating the action he performed using a similar environment to his many times without replicating the redirect he also did it again later and didn t receive the same problem  obviously whether it is on his side or ours it is not consistent  the question is have i missed anything obvious to check? could there be an apache / server level compromise doing this for example,have i missed anything obvious to check?   it seems to me like you ve done quite a bit of analysis local to you so you ve probably missed nothing  obvious  but there are some  subtle  things you might have missed as supplement to this answer i ll explain multiple attacks that could be so subtle and virtually out of your control that it s possible for any insecure website that uses a hostname and/or client that uses an insecure dns and https configuration i.e any that use plain old http and don t rely explicitly upon dnssec to fall victim and the attackers can sometimes virtually infeasible to actively shut down i ll also describe how you can prevent these  subtle  attacks in case you missed the subtle hints in this paragraph      could there be an apache / server level compromise doing this for example?   i guess you could call an insecure configuration a  compromise  especially if it s intentionally configured to be insecure there by an attacker the most dangerous of these misconfigurations could be present in the form of rogue administration accounts on a server rogue software installation rogue certificate authorities so on and so forth antivirus software may not detect all  compromises  misconfigurations and it s important to consider them in light of a  security regime  which consists of multiple components not just antivirus software  you should keep all of your software up-to-date particularly apache your os and particularly web browsers as there are attacks which target specific versions of apache your os and web browsers and i d suggest that all of those kinds of attacks are commonly used the ones described here however are less likely to be commonly observed owing to their risk factors or the level of skill required to reproduce them in ratio to the amount of maturity one must possess to establish that skill and  much  less likely to be detected by antivirus software owing to their existence as  flaws in configuration  rather than as  malware  for some reason there s a distinction between these two concepts i think there shouldn t be  simply put the internet is held in balance by the thin layer of ice which is the fact that the mature highly experienced users of the internet the top 1% if you like haven t decided to wage war against everyone on the planet sure there may be some russian and chinese hackers who ruin it but those malicious ip subnets can be blocked by firewalls and dnsbls their scans crippled by tarpits so on and so forth   the first attack to consider is as simple as a service provider filtering their customers traffic in doing so they could quite easily set up a phishing site over the top of yours or inject some javascript which redirects the user such an attack would be blatantly obvious and indefensible in court nonetheless you might still observe this  this could occur anywhere between your server and your client even on your own or their own routers as we ll inspect later for now we ll focus on the routers that exist between your network and your clients network which neither of you own this could include proxy servers and nameservers  typical isps run at least a caching dns resolver for the clients to reduce congestion along the up-stream network and that is itself a form of filtering some might even run proxy software which compresses media files and/or caches static html pages to reduce bandwidth for clients each of these  caches  has the potential to be tampered with internally or externally  internally a malicious employee at an isp could likely corrupt the local dns cache to give the client a different ip for your hostname or corrupt a proxy to send a different page or perhaps a different version of jquery that d be very blatant incredibly stupid attack as the risk of being caught in this highly illegal attack increases as attacks are repeated nonetheless if you re an american citizen best of luck getting a maliciously hosted public proxy hosted in china taken down..  besides without some source code for the page allegedly hosted by you that your client ended up on there s no way you could prove that an upstream provider somewhere between your client and your server has interfered with traffic you need to find that proof if you want to find the source or solve the problem if you want to solve the problem that source code is just one source of information you d need to obtain to track down the culprit  when a browser is sent a signed page from a server it will contact some  certificate authority  to ensure the certificate that signed the page legitimately came from the server that it s apparently from the responses sent by a certificate authority are themselves signed with keys which are generally hard-configured into your os/network configuration/browser and thus  fraudulently forging  such a response which we ll cover later with respect to  other attacks  would be even less practical than  somehow encouraging the end-users to overtly install a rogue certificate authority signature like convincing them to install malicious software  there s no doubt that a hardened ssl configuration at both ends server and end user will prevent all of the attacks i describe here   as it turns out even home routers nowadays have their own caching resolvers once again to reduce traffic congestion on the up-stream network thus a malicious machine on the same private network might have no problems infecting your router and corrupting its dns caching resolver  cue the cellular attacks: - a typical consumer-grade cell-phone internet user is technically also on a private network indeed the cell router may be misconfigured to allow clients to attack other clients the routers are 3g/hspda+ enabled introducing the potential for numerous electromagnetic attacks which tend to be encrypted but i suppose if a client enables roaming they might not necessarily know which towers they re connecting to or who runs those towers leading to a potential for mitm attacks which are similar to some other wireless network attacks  - the typical cell-phone client who has external access via some other provider can launch another style of attack against all other users of that mobile internet carrier within the local area could be as vast as state region and.. any insecure website.. could be yours could be all might be effected what s important is that the content be unencrypted end-to-end this client has everything they need to trigger the isps caching resolver to send a request for a zone you can basically think of this as a  domain  if you re uninitiated and to forge thousands of fake responses for the request which will all beat any legitimate response to the target  it s important to realise that a secure implementation of signed domain-verified encryption such as a hardened https configuration will cripple all of the attacks i describe here as i previously explained   attacks against dns themselves aren t few and far between there is a technique known as bitsquatting where-by a nefarious domain is registered which differs in  just one bit  from the target domain for example an attacker targeting an insecure http configuration hosted by stac exchange.com might register the domain stac exchange.com notice the difference between   and   is only  one bit  this targets any routers which might have ram errors that occasionally flip that bit  nonetheless a user connecting via a hardened https configuration will almost certainly be warned about invalid certificates if the attacker can t work out what their targets private key is in order to make the content appear legitimate this would be present as a clue from your users report if he/she said the browser said the certificate was invalid for example   those last few attacks make it  really  difficult to blame a server client or router anywhere between to prove  who  perhaps inadvertently tampered with the traffic you ll need to call administrators for  each router between yourself and the client  and see what they have in their caches this introduces extra higher-level challenges in your quest to track down the potential issue you may be quickly shut down by any foreign isps or authority who you approach to track this down they may speak a different language such as russian or chinese they may not have laws that criminalise these behaviours they may behave in a hostile manner towards you because of your race and they may not want to admit insecurities in their own network  however there are things you can do to protect yourself from this specific attack and as they say prevention is better than cure most significantly you should try to at least gracefully upgrade users to a secure ssl connection additionally if you do happen to get a call from a client and while you re on the phone they can repeatedly reproduce the issue consider instructing them to take steps such as clearing the local dns proxy and browser caches one at a time checking to see if the symptoms disappear each time this will tell you whether the clients network not just one computer is at fault or not additionally if you re not already using a dnssec-enabled nameserver for your zone you probably should consider migrating to one as that ll eliminate similar attacks for other non-http services  for the meantime i m going to assume http is the service you want to harden and since you can t guarantee users will harden their dns configuration you should rely upon browsers and oses hardening their https configurations instead and thus try to upgrade your users connections to https where possible   regarding the clients computer having no antivirus on os x this is not enough information to determine whether the clients network is to blame os x isn t exactly insecure sure they have the occasional vulnerability but those tend to get patched as with any os where clients go wrong here is when they don t apply the automatic updates or patches necessary to keep their system secure or they install rogue software themselves in this case default apple configurations nowadays use a similar  certificate authority  technique to ensure binaries are  signed  by apple or else pop up a warning to the user or flat out refuse to execute the program apple can of course revoke the legitimacy of a signature at their own discretion and they rely largely upon this to protect their users against malware it s a good system which package managers on linux tend to also follow  what s scariest of all is that there appears to be no antivirus software available to scan the software that executes on your printer thus some printers might be capable of attacking the users of the networks they re installed on or even external networks   in summary these are the things you might want to consider   keep your computer software up-to-date including your os any antivirus software which might or might not be necessary and  particularly  any browser software this goes for all internet users yourself included though for you there are some pieces of software you might want to consider tarpits and dnsbl integration software being a few  be wary of browser extensions as these may themselves tamper with pages or introduce vulnerabilities  host your zone on a dnssec-enabled nameserver just do it mate don t ummm and arrr about it this is like spf for email servers if you don t do it you ll eventually become a victim of an attack  configure your servers to gracefully upgrade your clients to ssl at the very least   the first place i would be looking to find what my server has done is in my logs a redirect issued as a header would show there but not a meta or javascript redirect  at least

   a common technique is arp spoofing so watch for changes of the arp table there are tools like arpwatch also watch for multiple responses to your arp requests  yes you can detect a man-in-the-middle attack on https in the browser by checking the https connection fingerprint is correct  for example if you wish to check  https://www.facebook.com  is not mitm attacked in internet explorer 11 uses two different windows because the view certificates dialog is modal   open  https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm  in ie11 on the desktop  open a new ie window ctrl-n on desktop and go to  https://www.facebook.com   click on the lock next to the address click on the view certificates button and a modal dialog pops up  on the general tab check that the issued to is *.facebook.com  on the details tab scroll to the bottom click on the fingerprint and check that the numbers and letters of the fingerprint match those displayed on  https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm  for *.facebook.com when comparing fingerprints ignore uppercase/lowercase differences and ignore spaces/colons   if you wish to check any other browser follow the instructions much further down the page under the heading how to display this page s or any page s ssl certificate fingerprint on  https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm   if you wish to check any other domain under the custom site fingerprinting heading near the top of the page you can request the official certificate name and fingerprint for any domain  this is a fairly robust way to detect man-in-the-middle proxy attacks for proxies on the machine or the network it won t detect any viruses etc that have infected the browser so called man-in-the-browser attacks  my two cents:if ur friend is on a *nix system he can first note the mac address of the router from the router web panel and then run the following command   arp -a   he can verfiy the mac address that the router is at in the arp table if the mac address of the router is different than what it should be that is one indication   secondly you can verify the dns resolutions for say facebook.com by running   nslookup  facebook.com   if the address returned is a local address say 192.168.0.105 or something this should indicate that ur dns resolutions are being hijacked  easier yet at the application layer i.e in the browser whenever ur browsing a website which uses credentials or anything sensitive check the url bar to determine if the communication is happening over https even if the traffic is being sniffed say by a lan connection to a switch your traffic would be unreadable to the attacker due to https,multipl tell friend might pick victim mitm vector friend connect slower usual?i facebook page exactli one see work school etc?compar sourceettercap mode design detect mitm attack friend make none method fool proof togeth build pictur possibl side effects.your friend bypass dns_spoof navig facebook ip 66.220.149.88 us vpn tunnel tor free slow said unlik friend victim mitm attack extrem probabl machin infect keyloggers.hav friend run viru scan clean check facebook secur set also friend use yahoo switch gmail,,virus|bypass|hijack|attacks|malware|spyware|spoofing|man in the middle,8,43,924,0.046536797000000005,30/09/2012 19:49,HT,Wants to know how to detect a mitm attack,AT,Describes actions for this and recommends steps for malware protection.

thursday today from the linked article it suggests that this attack against compression will not be as simple to turn off as was done to deter crime what can be done to mitigate this latest assault against http?  edit the presenters of breach have put up a  website  with further details the listed mitigations are   disabling http compression  separating secrets from user input  randomizing secrets per request  masking secrets  protecting vulnerable pages with csrf  length hiding  rate-limiting requests   note - also edited title and original question to clarify this attack is against http which may be encrypted not https specifically,breach like crime is a compression-related attack turning off compression makes the attack impossible   added  note that in this case it appears that you turn off a  different  compression configuration whereas crime exploits tls-layer compression breach exploits http-layer compression   the attack works by inferring info from the payload size artificially padding served https pages e.g a randomly sized comment string could mitigate its effectiveness  though the article is not full of details we can infer a few things    attack uses compression with the same general principle as  crime  the attacker can make a target system compress a sequence of characters which includes both a secret value that the attacker tries to guess and some characters that the attacker can choose that s a  chosen plaintext attack  the  compressed  length will depend on whether the attacker s string looks like the secret or not the compressed length leaks through ssl encryption because encryption hides  contents  not  length     the article specifically speaks of any secret that s [...] located in the  body  so we are talking about http-level compression not ssl-level compression http compression applies on the request body only not the header so secrets  in the header  in particular cookie values are safe from that one    since there are probe requests then the attack requires some malicious code in the client browser the attacker must also observe the encrypted bytes on the network and coordinate both elements this is the same setup as for crime and beast    it is unclear from the article alone which is all i have right now to discuss on whether the compressed body is one from the  client  or from the  server  probe request are certainly sent by the client on behalf of the attacker but responses from the server may include part of that which is sent in the request so the chosen plaintext attack can work both ways    in any case breach looks like an attack  methodology  which needs to be adapted to the specific case of a target site in that sense it is not new at all it was already well-known that compression leaks information and there was no reason to believe that http-level compression was magically immune heck it was discussed  right here  last year it is a good thing however that some people go the extra mile to show  working demonstrations  because otherwise flaws would never be fixed for instance padding oracle attacks against cbc had been described and even prototyped in 2002 but it took an actual demo against asp in 2010 to convince microsoft that the danger was real similarly for beast in 2011 the need for unpredictable iv for cbc mode was known since 2002 as well and crime in 2012 breach is more crime ii one more layer of pedagogy to strike down the unbelievers  unfortunately a lot of people will get it wrong and believe it to be an attack against ssl which it is not it has nothing to do with ssl really it is an attack which forces an information leak through a low-bandwidth data channel the  data length  that ssl has never covered and never claimed to cover  the one-line executive summary is that  thou shalt not compress   i just thought of a way to add randomizing secrets per request length hiding and rate-limiting requests to a csrf mitigation measure   consider which forms you wouldn t want an attacker to post on the user s behalf these are the forms you d protect from csrf  for each page view generate a random salt of random length send this salt as a hidden input the random length should help add noise to lengths even if your front-end load balancer strips comments or otherwise minifies your html  compute a hash of the salt the session id and a server-side secret and send this csrf key as another hidden input  optionally log the salt or csrf key to a table this allows for rate limiting a particular user account or ip address to a number of hashes per hour and for limiting replays of a particular salt  when you process the form compute the hash in the same way as the previous steps using the salt in the form and make sure it matches the csrf key,though

i ignore because is old and not use in modern computers or not,there are millions of 32-bit systems still in use today and the 64-bit systems all use thunking to run 32-bit programs  lots most of the apps out there are still released today only as 32-bit apps in order to remain backward compatible with as many systems as possible  many will remain 32-bit forever or until 32-bit support is ended because there is no compelling reason for the app developer to migrate their app to 64-bit  very few apps actually need 64-bit capabilities or would make full use of them if they had it  video games multimedia and other extremely high ram-intensive apps can definitely take advantage of all 64 bits but the average one-step-at-a-time apps won t gain the users any noticeable benefit from being ported while if they convert to 64-bit they lose any clients that are still running a 32-bit os  remember there are still systems in the world running windows xp because people need it to keep running old 16-bit apps that came out under windows 95 or windows 3.1!  consider that microsoft s flagship development environment visual studio 2017 is still a 32-bit app  it can emit 64-bit binaries of course but the whole ide itself is still 32-bit and will remain so for quite a while  these guys absolutely understand what it means to be 32-bit or 64-bit  so what message does that send you?  it s not an either-or choice as you can certainly pick up both  but 32-bit apps aren t going away any time in the foreseeable future so time spent learning the 32-bit environment is not time wasted  and if they contain easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities by ignoring them you could be missing out on more than half the bugs in the world  architecture and register r*x differences  over time many 64-bit architectures have been introduced the first to be supported by windows itanium was designed for performance computing and was not compatible with x86 amd later introduced a 64-bit architecture called amd64 which was compatible with x86 code intel adopted amd64 and called its implementation em64t this architecture is now known as x64 or x86-64 and it is the most popular implementation of 64-bit code on windows   https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-x64-assembly   for 64-bit programming the general-purpose registers are rax rbx rcx rdx rbp rsi rdi and rsp     rax addressable as eax/ax/ah/al plays the standard role of an  accumulator it is also used as the placeholder for the return value  of a function call all registers of this set are addressable in a  32/16/8-bit size as well      rbx plays the standard role of base indexing during memory access      rcx is normally used as a counter      rdx is normally used for data operations during division and data type  extensions using eax during multiplication in tandem      rbp is normally used as a base pointer      rdi is used as the destination index      rsi is used as the source index      rsp is the stack pointer   there are 8 more general-purpose registers that can be used anyway r8 r9 r10 r11 r12 r13 r14 and r15  x64 also supports instruction pointerûûrelative data addressing this is an important difference between x64 and x86 in relation to pic and shellcode specifically in x86 assembly anytime you want to access data at a location that is not an offset from a register the instruction must store the entire address this is called absolute addressing but in x64 assembly you can access data at a location that is an offset from the current instruction pointer the x64 literature refers to this as rip-relative addressing  there is also some major differences in the calling conventions used by major operating systems under a 64-bit architecture check the books practical malware analysis chapter 21 on 64-bit malware and gray hat hacking the ethical hacker s handbook 4th edition chapter 22 on analyzing 64-bit malware for full details  pe32 vs pe32+ differences  the pe format which was originally designed for 32 bits had to undergo some minor changes the new format that supports 64-bit windows is called pe32+ sometimes people refer to it as pe64 -- they are interchangeable they are the same thing no new fields were added so structurally the two formats are still the same with the modifications listed  here          fields widened to support 64 bits      baseofdata field deleted      magic field value changed from 0x10b to 0x20b representing  different cpu type       malware/rootkit differences e.g in the meterpreter implant   windows   the primary incentive for malware to be compiled as a 64-bit binary is the ability to inject code into other 64-bit processes and load kernel drivers that have to be 64-bit executables  injections techniques will not work when you are trying to inject a dll from 64-bit processes into 32-bit processes or vice versa due to the windows-on-windows for 64-bit wow64 kernel specifically 64-bit processes require pointers that are 64 bits so the pointer we passed to   for   would need to be a 64-bit pointer because our injection application is 32 bits we cannot specify a 64-bit pointer how do you get around this?

21205,sse,11,0.933101118,audit|penetration-test,why is penetration testing important,in improving the security of an organization it seems as though an  audit  of existing code procedures policies infrastructure etc would be absolutely sufficient to reveal any security or policy deficiencies and therefore an actual demonstration of that deficiency though a commissioned penetration test would be unnecessary  what benefit therefore does red team penetration testing provide to an organization beyond the benefit gained though an audit furthermore would there be significant benefit in contracting with a firm to conduct regular penetration tests against an organization in addition to the otherwise scheduled security audits,while in audit my catch many of the same issues as pen-testing its results are less definitive while a pen-testerhacker my not be skilled enough to access your system if they are it will be obvious   i would say the most important difference however is mindset security teams and auditors tend to examine things from the perspective of making -- they want things to work in other words they are more inclined to create large unnecessary apparatus the larger the structure the more vulnerabilities it may contain  pen-testers take the opposite approach they have no interest making a system only breaking it they have trained themselves to be alert for any means of access -- including  social engineering   all of this combined gives pen-testers a definite place in security  as a last point hacking is about creativity -- out-thinking the security team and pen-testers are more likely to be creative then auditors  i hope this presents my argument clearly   one important benefit gained though through red-team testing is that it gives security personnel real experience in dealing with an actual intrusion the company may indeed have all the important policies in place but until they actually have to deal with an attacker inside their network they may not be certain as to how to proceed much like a fire drill a penetration test allows them to develop a working strategy for how to proceed in an otherwise unusual environment  for example while a lot of attention is given to the subject of preventing and detecting an outside attack very little is often proscribed in how to  remove  an attacker from the network without having to deal with this type of event the security personnel may be left guessing as to the best way to evict the attacker while at the same time protecting the integrity and operation of their critical infrastructure a real-world attacker could leverage this inexperience to persist his access even after the cleanup is presumbed to be complete  computer science is just that a science  it would be very scientific to just hypothesize that you are secure without actually putting it to the test   you can perform source code analysis and other whitebox testing methodologies to find all sorts of interesting and high impact vulnerabilities..  but what if no one  could actually exploit these issues ?  you can t get hacked with an unexploitable vulnerability  yet systems are broken into on a regular basis  an insider could exploit an issue like this  but that is a different question.  penetration testing to me is about using the  scientific method  to try and answer the simple question  in a real world scenario what could a hacker do to harm my system or to my company?  to answer this question you get a skilled hacker or team of hackers and purposefully debilitate them by not providing source code or access to the development team   an ideal penetration test is a strictly blackbox testing scenario  just provide a company name  or an ip address range or even physical address  that is all the all the information an attacker should need the cissp has a section of physical security for a reason.  at the end of the penetration test you should receive a report with findings  a good penetration test will  always  have findings  there is no perfect system  everyone can take steps to improve security  from the results of penetration test you can identify weaknesses in your system and it can help you decide how to spend your resources to improve the security of your  system as a whole   another important aspect which has not been touched upon is  cost  so considering the fact that a company does not have an in-house software security group the only way the company can audit their security stature is through pen-tests by hiring consultants specifically for the job now pen-testing will yield results if performed properly afaik pen testing is the cheapest form of assessing your security standing there are several apps for static code analysis true but the licenses for these applications cost a lot and you would also need a person who can identify false positives,comput scienc scienc would scientif hypothes secur without actual put test perform sourc code analysi whitebox test methodolog find sort interest high impact vulnerabilities.. one could actual exploit issu ?

since we re already in an  attribute we can manipulate the   element we re injecting into in order to execute script   this creates the following output   note that the   attribute doesn t do anything it s just there to let us maintain valid html unknown attributes are just ignored  in this case when the user s mouse enters the input element it executes the javascript and we get xss again  but requiring user interaction sucks! we could use   but this is often finnicky instead we can utilise some css tricks to force the user interaction   this then becomes   the style here looks like a mouthful but it s quite simple   make the element display as a block element so we can size it arbitrarily  make the element s position absolute within the window so we can set its position to anywhere  move the element to 0,0  make the element completely fill the page so the user s mouse  has  to enter it!  make the element appear on top of everything else   hopefully this explains how this all works and how you can go from the example given by zap to a working xss exploit","autom check work put script tag contain random token everi field exampl might becom maintain map field random valu chose case foo=147230578 bar=561972456 order trace paramet inject check see appear page without encod string found know xss like possibl either appear page got html encod case found get string reflect back identifi field inject reason execut script tag got inject html attribut look inject happen html malform browser render tri make best ignor tag close everyth see assum content render page instead inject paramet get time input tag close caus tag get execut success xss! end get treat content bonu round might vulner paramet allow triangl brackets?

and the options seem to be protecting data from a database administrator account vs external users  i am not positive what my answer to this question is so which group am i trying to protect from?  further info i am storing user-specific confidential information in a database the only person authorized to see this information is the user who has signed in using a username and password the data needs to be protected in as many situations as possible,securosis actually did a great job no surprise here covering this in their article  i m not sure if i got enough info here but if - as i`m guessing - we are talking about multi-user setup in which each user has access privileges for his/hers db partition then for me this is classified more as a user encryption/tokenization scenario   having said that i fully agree with @greg_dolph this is not an only one right answer situation and in this case both is probably the right way to go     transparent database encryption tde or encryption at web server to protect data in a database   transparent database encryption means that you can t bypass database access controls by looking at the files stored on the disk  you say your information is confidential you should be doing this  encryption at web server -- sounds vague could mean one of two things    disk encryption of the web server s hard disk  or encryption of the directory on the hard disk where the database is stored  seems unnecessary to protect data in the database if you have tde enabled  granted their could be other sensitive data on the disk e.g the web server code that an attacker could exploit to find holes so you could consider disk encryption in that case  note full disk encryption really only protects you for the case of physically going to the server and removing a hard drive and loading it into another computer to look at the data  but the idea behind tde is that all the data in the db is inaccessible    encryption for data transfer  that is your web server is https-only with clients accessing your site only though a valid trusted certificate so all connections/data transfers to your application are encrypted to anyone eavesdropping for network traffic  you definitely need this if you want to keep your data secure otherwise its trivial to steal another user s authentication information to get at their confidential information    this is where understanding your risks and threats is essential - every industry and every organisation has a different risk profile  to give you a couple of examples    a global oil company s key threat actors may be ecological activists terrorists foreign governments and competitors - all external but with different attack vectors foreign governments may use well funded stealthy exploits in order to gain access to valuable well data whereas terrorists may be more concerned with physical access to wells in order to plant explosives    a health service while wanting to protect private medical data from disclosure may have a stronger priority of maintaining system uptime in order to provide healthcare services to critically ill patients their key threat identified may be the risk of outage so controls will be focused around that rather than preventing an attacker gaining access    so have you carried out an assessment of your risks and threat groups?

120711,sse,11,0.46191477799999997,attack-prevention|attack-vector|attacks|nmap|ports,why do hackers scan for open ports,so whenever you hear of the  mean little hackers who hack websites  you hear of port scanning i understand what it is looking for all open ports / services on a remote machine however that begs the question  why would an attacker want to know what ports are open?  the only reason i see for this is looking for services that  may  or  may  not   have the default username and password or a vulnerability or something  but seeing as the odds for this are quite low why do hackers perform port scans? is it purely for the reason above,consider that i wanna rob your home .. then i would look up for a way to get into but your home has door locks that allows only your localfamily to access it so i will search for some other like wayports windowsother open public ports to get into.and try to get some data.if ports will be open for ssh/ftp they try to exploit them try uploading files or bruteforce   to run an exploit an attacker needs a vulnerability  to find a vulnerability the attacker needs to fingerprint all services which run on the machine find out which protocol they use which programs implement them and preferably the versions of those programs  to fingerprint a service the attacker needs to know that there is one running on a publicly accessible port  to find out which publicly accessible ports run services the attacker needs to run a port scan   as you see a port scan is the first reconnaissance step an attacker performs before attacking a system  have you ever tried to perform network communications with a rock?  how about a network router that has no electricity?  it s pretty boring because you get no response  so attackers try to use the most common network protocols like tcp and udp which use numbers that are called port numbers or ports   sctp also uses ports .  if a port is closed then there s typically one of two results a response that indicates connection refused or no response whatsoever  well either of those results are far less interesting than an open port which simply means that the attacker can get some other type of response when trying to interact with the targeted device  port scanning can refer to scanning the entire possible range of port numbers 0 through 65535 or simply scanning from a list of likely ports e.g 80 443 25 22 to see what ip addresses respond  ip addresses that respond to a port number are likely targets for attackers to focus additional efforts to interact with particularly if the port number which responds is the number of a commonly used standard e.g tcp port 80 is the most common port for http  although people can use a port for a different purpose than what is standard that is quite uncommon to do mostly because a lot of software doesn t handle alternate port numbers as easily  for instance the standard for web browsers is to require adding a colon and the port number if a non-standard port is used  using standard port numbers can eliminate the need for people to type that information.  scanning a port also has advantages over trying to perform more elaborate interactions like many network attacks  the required time and bandwidth is much lower so scanning can be done much more quickly than attacks that are more elaborate  once an application has answered on a specific port that application could then be targeted for exploits for instance  nmap  will fingerprint and report software and applications found running on a server sometimes with version information outdated versions will have publicly-known vulnerabilities which software such as  metaspoit  could target   this guy  explains it well as an analogy an open port is like an open door once one door is opened the device in question can be used to target other devices in the same network the linked document explains how the author got into the  hacking team  s internal network and leaked their data  as girish points out a port scan is like casing a house  its a a very low noise activity when done from the internet because you ll see dozens of port scans a day  it also gleans a small amount of information about the state of your machine and that lets them tailor the next layer of the attack even more  it s also  dirt cheap!   doing a port scan costs the attacker almost nothing and sometimes you get lucky  in  the art of intrusion  kevin mitnick gives examples of where such attacks do pay off in real life  in a simple system its easy to simply lock down all of the ports  in a more complicated it network its harder to prove there is no business logic reason for an open port and first rule of it is do not upset the business so they may be left open  mitnick s book gave the example of one case where there was a jury rigged serial connection accidentally exposed to the internet  the attacker presumes it was a one time cludge to solve an issue which was never dismantled after its use was no longer required  years later it was actually the attack vector found and exploited by the hackers  there are situations where port scans are avoided  advanced persistent threats apt tend to operate on the lan  while port scans from the internet are a daily affair port scans originating on the lan are quite a lot louder  given that apts value stealth they will often avoid port scans that in other circumstances might just be random pot shots taken to see if one gets lucky  hacking has a discovery phase during the discovery phase you discover as much information about your target as possible port scanning is just one aspect of discovery most software will run on their default port and thus knowing which ports are open gives you some information as to what the machine is running if port 80 and 443 are open then you re likely dealing with some form of webserver then you discover what webserver is running and what software the webserver is running an open port means that something is listening on that port and that you can communicate with whatever is running on that port which is a potential entry for a hacker trying default username &amp password combinations is just one part of hacking using vulnerabilities in software running on the traget is another part and to discover what software is running port scanning is a good first step if you don t know which ports are open you don t know to which ports you can send malicous packets to,run exploit attack need vulner find vulner attack need fingerprint servic run machin find protocol program implement prefer version program fingerprint servic attack need know one run publicli access port find publicli access port run servic attack need run port scan see port scan first reconnaiss step attack perform attack system,,leak|attacks|exploit|attack vector|vulnerability|attack prevention|known vulnerabilities,7,30,1139,0.026338893999999998,16/04/2016 23:41,DH,Wants clarification as to why hackers scan for open ports,Ex,Explains why they would need it in context of an attack

133456,sse,11,0.489955097,ddos|denial-of-service,can a ddos attack yield any information,can a ddos attack reveal any information or be used to mount a hack? my understanding is that the whole point of ddos or dos is to consume all of the resources/overload the server causing it to crash and that being the only reason to do a ddos   i have heard that ddos is used to get information is that true or totally false,a ddos will certainly give an attacker information about response times load capability and routing  it may also give information about how incidents are handled internally and externally as well as how they are reported to the public  but this is not what the main uses are  generally the two key reasons for ddos are to   take a service or website offline  distract from a wider attack exploit or intrusion   the first is well known very popular and is relatively straightforward to carry out with the only defence against a large attack being a high volume ddos mitigation service  the second is more rarely used but is being seen as a part of an attacker s toolset loading the incident response team can make it harder for them to detect an intrusion can hide the real reason for the attack and can hide evidence of an intrusion in amongst large numbers of log entries from the ddos  it s usually not incredibly intrusive it depends on the ports that are open and the packets that are sent ddos can come from people bruteforcing your server s details and databases especially over lan and can imply a discreet bruteforce attack in some cases a typical web server is hard to hack i host web and for video games ask a professional or i d assume it s an unavoidable vulnerability  identify shared resources  a  denial of service  attack distributed or not can be used to successfully identify machines which share resources if you want to hack a service you can launch an attack against it while monitoring other services if those also disappear it is likely that they are hosted on the same machine these other services may be more prone to hacking and can be used as a crowbar to gain access to the service you want  hidden services  this can be devastating when used against  hidden services  in the tor network if you have reasons to believe that a certain individual is hosting a hidden service you can test this by launching an attack against an open service on the same hardware or in the same data center if the hidden service goes down you may have confirmed that your guess is correct and the identity behind the hidden service has been compromised  each time you test this you will get one sample which may be a false positive doing it enough times at random intervals you can increase the probability of being right  a real world example of this happening is with steam they experienced an dos attack on christmas day in response to that they changed the caching rules of the steam service so customers could still access the store page unfortunately they ended up making a configuration error which sometimes caused users to see the personal information of other users  systems sometimes have unexpected behavior under heavy system load which can lead to security vulnerabilities its a possibility for hackers to exploit this but they are unlikely able to plan for this and the exploit is likely unpredictable they also have to deal with the fact that the server is probably slow to respond due to the heavy load    a full answer would be depending on the attack and what would be attacked so i will keep it general  a dos can leak information as a side-effect in earlier times switches were used in networks to prevent machines to listen to the communication between 2 other machines due to a design problem you could turn it into a big collision domain again by launching a dos attack against the switch and you can listen to any communication again.explanation of the attack:switches learn which machine is connected to which port when a machine sends a packet to another machine the switch looks up in his memory at which port this machine is and forwards the traffic to only this port a machine on another port wouldn t see the traffic a problem arises when there are more machines on the network then what would fit in the memory of the switch common behaviors are   the would send all traffic to all ports  the switch would stop learning new machines  the switch would forget the oldest machines   especially common were the first type.a attacker would let his machine to pretend to have a hugh amount of machines to be at this port by dosing it with announcement-broadcasts  another attack related to dos is a security downgrade attack.you have a system consisting of 2 sub-systems a and b b is used by a to do additional security checks if b doesn t respond in time a would skip this check and consider it successfull if the attacker can dos system b he has an easier game because he only needs to pass the security checks on system a some systems are designed this way because availibility of system a is important and nobody thought some attacker might dos system b or would accept the risk i can t give you the details of an actual attack but some anti-spam blacklists work this way  it is also known that some advanced groups/organizations launch ddos attacks to distract from their real attack by attracting the focus of the security staff on the target of the ddos or hide the attack traffic between the ddos traffic  another option is that you need that amount of traffic but don t need to ddos it for example some attacks on ssl require enough packets to recover/manipulate information here the dos would be a side effect of the amount of traffic  it is possible to use a ddos attack to gain information in addition to the answers by rory alsop and h idden which focus on gaining infrastructure information or overloading the incident response team so other attacks stay undetected longer there are a few other possibilities    auto scale applications  - when working with an application platform that auto scales a ddos attack may use the fact that they auto scale to do something this would have to be in concert with some other kind of attack or information but the general idea is that if you know enough to exploit the reboot process you could use ddos to force a new server online witch would go through the reboot process allowing your exploit it s important to note that this is in addition to an already existing security problem it s just the tool by which the totally different exploit is brought online or maybe tested  a sample i can think of is a production server hosting it s code base in a public github repo when scales pulls new code into the server then starts you could add bad code to that github repo if not managed correctly force a restart and have your exploit   first come first served applications  - there are some applications that are first come first serve in some part of their process irc from comments is an example but there are others any service that reserves something for a user on a first come first served approach can  be exploited via ddos either by taking up all the slots till a specific person get s theirs or by forcing a reboot and getting anther chance at slots after the restart these are pretty common and while a service that uses this for authentication is a bit odd it s not unheard of in fact licencing services do this all the time first user with a licence of abc is the qualified user of abc if that data is lost after a reboot then ddos could cause that reboot and get their foot in the door    startup vulnerabilities  - i have seen quite a few times where a server boot resulted in services being left on just in case for example  let s leave ssh passwords on after reboot then turn them off after a couple of hours just in case we need emergency access or ftp is on for 30 mins after reboot this is more common on network appliances things like insecure wifi access for the first 2 mins or anything can upload anything for 2 mins usually this is part of an upgrade/update mechanism for example a cisco router may accept any tftp data it finds after reboot some computers will listen for any netboot server at restart ddos can kick off the restart and allow your bad code a way in  in essence a ddos by it s self can tell you some things but usually only stuff that is useless on it s own a ddos in conjunction with other attack vectors can be extremely effective   note  the methods used here would work in a lab but there low hanging fruit for a security team or even just regular it while they do exist in the wild an attacker would have to have gained access/knowledge of internals way beyond that of someone just doing a ddos    forcing the server boot time   one thing that has been mentioned tangentially in the comments but not addressed in any of the other quite excellent answers is that it can occasionally be useful to know when an application/server booted up  for example certain horribly insecure random number generators which should never be used for security related tasks but invariably are every now and again use the system time as their random seed  with that being the case if you can deduce when the rng was seeded preferably within a couple of minutes of accuracy and have some samples of generator output it is reasonably trivial to find the seed and rebuild the rng state to predict future tokens  now ordinarily a server should not expose it s start time though again some invariably do however if a ddos attack can be used to force a server reboot then you ve gained knowledge of the server start time  this can lead to a variety of token based attacks like session hijacking  what about a timing attack? this has been discussed as a possible security vulnerability in  java   python  probably many others and actually might appear to be a dos attack  when various libraries check for equality generally they ready byte by byte and compare returning false if not matching - if something like that is used in checking password/cookie theoretically they can time the longest request and assume it got farther through the comparison  i assume that dos attack can be used alongside with race-condition kind of exploit when server is heavily loaded exploit will be easier to use  however dos-attack alone can yield some info as it was shown in previous answers - about routing response time and internal incident handling  a ddos attack could exploit a vulnerability  in theory a ddos attack could not only distract from an exploit as mentioned in another answer but it could also be combined with one  consider the  heartbleed bug  that returned information when a server was contacted in a particular way   one could increase the information gained from the server by contacting the server in a ddos attack and collecting the information that was released in this way   it may be fixed but i know in the early days of group policy one exploit was to overload the group policy server and in some configurations the local policy would be applied  so we would configure local policy as minimal  you could only use the denial as an exploit the server policy reduced authority  i know i don t have all the terms correct - it has been a while since i did group policy admin  let say you had compromised a router but that router was not getting the traffic you wanted   you could do a dos on a good router to hopefully get traffic to the hack

53841,sse,11,0.45787999,key-management,how secure is switching keys if breaking the key is an intractable problem,let s say that you create a system where a secret is hidden and revealed by a particular key  as well the key can be broken but it would take thousands of years  if you keep switching the keys frequently enough that no computer is able to break the key in time is your system secure?  ...well apart from getting that key stolen,assuming no other variables and parameters come into play than the ones that you have described then yes your system is secure  if and only if  the method of hiding the secret is secure i.e it is not vulnerable to any ciphertext-only or chosen-ciphertext attacks in both of these attack types the knowledge of the key is not required  so for example if your method of hiding the secret is ceaser-cipher the strength of your key will be immaterial  the concept you are talking about is key rotation key rotation has pros and cons while you are changing the key so it can t be found this usually means you need to de-crypt and re-encrypt that processes can now be attacked because there is a period where the data is now plaintext  the attack you describe would be basic brute forcing or targeted brute forcing if there was some flaw in the implementation or a way of breaking it was detected however keys can also be exposed in other ways   accidental exposure such as putting it on an insecure flash drive  the key can be stolen such as someone attacks your host system or steals your secured device  coercion or torture you are forced to give over your key    the security of the system and the security of the key are related but should be approached separately the system is implementing some algorithm to protect information can i attack the system to get the functions to send me a copy of the data when its decrypted or can i gain some man-in-the-middle access? breaking the key may not be as cost effective as looking for other weaknesses in the system on the server or client side changing your key has no impact on the reliability of the system however if the system was compromised and then later secured changing a key might be a good idea because now the attacker has it and there is always the potential of attack    this article  disucsses some pros and cons of key rotation,assum variabl paramet come play one describ yes system secur method hide secret secur i.e vulner ciphertext-onli chosen-ciphertext attack attack type knowledg key requir exampl method hide secret ceaser-ciph strength key immateri,,flaws|attacks|weakness|protection|vulnerability|man in the middle,6,13,417,0.03117506,21/03/2014 14:49,DH,Wants to know security context of a key switchig scenario,Co,Confirms that the scenario is secure but details the caveats

155704,sse,6,0.387684077,dns|dns-spoofing,dns hijack redirect from one https hostname to another,i just finished reading a  wired article  about a dns hijack where the attackers redirected all bank traffic to servers they hosted on google cloud what i thought was interesting about the story is that they redirected to valid https websites with certificates for some legitimacy     but the brazilian bank attackers exploited their victimEEEEEEEEEEs dns in a  more focused and profit-driven way kaspersky believes the attackers  compromised the bankEEEEEEEEEEs account at registro.br thatEEEEEEEEEEs the domain  registration ,this type of attack is not new and can simply occur from something as simple as the use of a bad password with a dns registrar and no two-factor authentication in place  it s also important to note this is dns redirection and not https redirection  in a nutshell there are two parts to this attack   setting up look-alike website with valid https  accessing the bank s dns registrar account to redirect their traffic   note a similar scenario could also occur if an attacker can compromise the bank s dns servers replacing access to the dns registar in step 2  looking a little closer at step 1 above  when someone sets up a fake website they typically aim to mirror 3 things   1a.  the look and feel of the site  easy to just download the real html and images from the bank s real website and change the form entries to do what you want it will be identical to what users are used to seeing and requiring almost no work on the attackers part note if registering a look-a-like domain name first the attackers will likely make it look like a new bank getting a website up until the moment they launch their attack at which point they switch everything to the look-a-like site   1b.  optionally they can register a similar domain name  this isn t actually required at all for the attack you mentioned and since so few people look closely at their browser if ssl is established showing green almost any domain name would work but you could easily get a similar looking name if needed  1c.  register an ssl/tls certificate for whichever domain is used in step 1b  above again it could be for a website for notabank.com and that s a legitimate domain name to request an ssl/tls certificate for alternatively and as was the case in the situation you describe they can simply use   lets encrypt    2. for accessing the dns registrar s account similar attacks have occurred against companies that simply used a bad password or their companies name as the password that being the case a simple set of brute-force attempts would give someone access to this account similarly this could have been compromised by finding similar passwords used by the administrator of the bank s dns either on another system or via a public password dump from when passwords were lost at another site there are lots of ways someone could have lost a password here given most dns registrars don t require mandatory two-factor authentication in a lot of cases just having the username and password is all one needs to access this account    once logged into the dns registrar s site as the target account the attackers can literally change the dns settings for www.bank.com to any ip address in the world  so naturally they point it to the fake banking websites they created in step 1 above and start harvesting credentials   if credentials are all they want they can easily grab these as people try to log in and use them to gain access to accounts one by one more elaborate attackers or attacks against sites which implement two-factor authentication will allow the attacker to authenticate via a proxy running on the fake site which redirects the use of the logout function to a fake exit page this allows an attacker to be authenticated by the user including use of the end users two-factor authentication system then gives them access to the account as soon as the unsuspecting client chooses to log out this is more work for the attacker but it can get the attacker past two-factor authentication requirements and also will go on longer before being reported where in the case of just grabbing credentials it may appear to users that the banks  website is not working and likely to get reported faster     i ll also mention that there are systems in place at many banks to help detect this type of fraudulent activity and typically as soon as multiple users start authenticating from a single ip address that may warrant a security check to see if this type of attack is occurring and then action will be taken by the banks security teams to contact the isp hosting the fraudulent site to get it taken down   there are lots of other similar scenarios but this is typically how it works    in regard to the certificate warning  if i type www.bank.com and i get redirected to a valid website using a valid certificate why would i get any warning? think of it as if i meant to go to www.bank.com but my browser redirected me to  https://security.stackexchange.com  when the browser loads the new site all it s checking for is certificate validation on the new site the browser has no knowledge of your intentions to visit www.bank.com so if the user isn t checking the url in the browser either bad things can happen  you can play with this yourself by setting a line in your /etc/host file  or it s equivalent so that www.bank.com resolves to the ip of anything you want and get the same effect locally      for example if i type in to my browser  https://www.santanderbank.com  and an attacker has taken over that dns can they redirect that to a valid  https://www.santanderb4nk.com  without the browser warning me? assume the attacker has the certificate to www.santanderb4nk.com but does not have the certificate to www.santanderbank.com   for a redirection a http request has to be made which results in a redirect response i.e http response code 302 or similar and a location header when redirecting away from a https site to some other site the browser first has to make a successful tls connection to the original site in order to send the http request and get the http response which contains the redirection to make a successful tls connection the certificate for this original site needs to be valid i.e signed by a trusted ca and matching the name of the site as visible in the url i.e dns cname attacks will not help  this means the scenario you describe where the attacker does not have a valid certificate for the original site will usually result in a warning inside the browser but the attack might work silently if the user is using some ssl intercepting software like certain antivirus or adware which does not properly validate certificates as described in  this paper   but i think the wired article describes a different scenario in which the attacker successfully got valid certificates for the real domains in this case   no warnings will occur since the browser usually does not care which ca issued a certificate as long as the ca is trusted  hpkp  can help against this kind of attack     my question is how did they do that if you attempt access a website using https then can an attacker who controls the dns for the hostname redirect your request to another https website without any certificate warning? .. assume the attacker has the certificate toÂ www.santanderb4nk.comÂ but does not have the certificate toÂ www.santanderbank.com   that sounds like an incorrect assumption from my reading here s what i got  servers do not naturally belong to a website domain they have ip addresses that point to them and if you visit them they can optionally return a website dns is merely a pointer to an ip address  if the attackers changed the ip addresses in the bank s dns records then their servers are now the site  one of  the two ways let s encrypt validates ownership of a domain  is by querying for a requested dns record if the attackers had control of the bank s dns then they could add the record and as far as let s encrypt could tell they were the official owners of the domain so they were issued a certificate for,type attack new simpli occur someth simpl bad password dns registrar two-factor authent place also import note dns redirect http redirect nutshel two part attack set look-alik websit valid http access bank dns registrar account redirect traffic note similar scenario could also occur attack compromis bank dns server replac access dns registar step 2 look littl closer step 1 someon set fake websit typic aim mirror 3 thing 1a. look feel site easi download real html imag bank real websit chang form entri want ident user use see requir almost work attack part note regist look-a-lik domain name first attack like make look new bank get websit moment launch attack point switch everyth look-a-lik site 1b. option regist similar domain name actual requir attack mention sinc peopl look close browser ssl establish show green almost domain name would work could easili get similar look name need 1c. regist ssl/tl certif whichev domain use step 1b could websit notabank.com legitim domain name request ssl/tl certif altern case situat describ simpli let encrypt 2. access dns registrar account similar attack occur compani simpli use bad password compani name password case simpl set brute-forc attempt would give someon access account similarli could compromis find similar password use administr bank dns either anoth system via public password dump password lost anoth site lot way someon could lost password given dns registrar requir mandatori two-factor authent lot case usernam password one need access account log dns registrar site target account attack liter chang dns set www.bank.com ip address world natur point fake bank websit creat step 1 start harvest credenti credenti want easili grab peopl try log gain access account one one elabor attack attack site implement two-factor authent allow attack authent via proxi run fake site redirect logout function fake exit page allow attack authent user includ end user two-factor authent system give access account soon unsuspect client choos log work attack get attack past two-factor authent requir also go longer report case grab credenti may appear user bank websit work like get report faster also mention system place mani bank help detect type fraudul activ typic soon multipl user start authent singl ip address may warrant secur check see type attack occur action taken bank secur team contact isp host fraudul site get taken lot similar scenario typic work regard certif warn type www.bank.com get redirect valid websit use valid certif would get warning?

76809,sse,12,0.269833088,cryptography|csrf|php,would this generated csrf token be considered cryptographically strong,i am working on enhancing the security of an existing web application which currently has not implemented the use of anti-csrf tokens so it is up to me to generate one add the hidden fields and checks etc a limitation right now is that neither the openssl or mcrypt modules are currently configured on the server  here is my token-generating code   i have a feeling that this would provide an adequate token but not a particularly strong one but that s my own personal instinct does anybody have any suggestions as to how i can strengthen the security of this token without the use of mcrypt or openssl functions? thank you!  edit this is currently how i am verifying the token after the form is submitted where $token is the token passed along with the request,i would say no  here  is an interesting article on a similar topic  i would suggest   using a hash function this does not add virtually any security on its own but makes improvements mentioned below much more efficient e.g    adding a long random secret constant this adds security  while the secret constant remains secret  - this value may be very easy read in shared-hosting server e.g    reading some bytes from   if this is available and adding them to value being hashed  this adds real security  without use of php extensions mentioned in question post e.g    add client ip and port this improves security a bit especially if client ip address is not known to attacker e.g    this does not improve security but makes the generation algorythm more understandable - remove uniqid stuff and replace it with pure   e.g    added later add http   request header to input of hash function this has dual effect on security - good part is that csrf token depends also on session cookie so attacker must know/guess victim s session cookie to calculate csrf token - in most cases session cookie is more critical bad part is that attacker may try to guess session cookies based on any csrf tokens saved in browser history to make this guess computationally harder at the expense of server resources   header can be hashed alone before adding it e.g     p.s notice that variable-length digit strings are concatenated using non-digit separators to avoid some non-equivalent string sets resulting in equivalent concatenated values  p.s.2 looks like there is a bracket   missing in question post code  p.s.3 more on meaning of cryptographic hash function here hash function does the following    adds  no entropy  - has functions are deterministic hash function will always produce the same output from each particular input it is important to understand that no entropy is added even if length of string is increased sha-256 from string a will be 32 bytes long but it will still be a well known value you can just google this hash in hexadecimal to find out how popular it actually is  mixes and obfuscates this time obfuscate does not mean something avoidable and insecure the input - the only way attacker can determine the input is by guessing it basically hash function introduces an all-or-nothing principle - either attacker knows entire input and can verify it by computing the hash or attacker does not know which parts of the input he has predicted are correct as a result hash function allows to increase security by adding a long random secret constant step 2 mentioned above without use of the hash function attacker would see the constant in all observed csrf tokens thus he would know what the constant is and that it must be added   very closely related to 2. makes attacker to spend some computational resources with each guess of the input of hash function in article mentioned above the attacker uses gpu video card because he must do large number of guesses and that would take very long time on cpu the more complex less predictable input of the hash function is the more computational resources attacker must use to guess the input if the attacker has enough computational resources for guessing the input of the hash function used to generate csrf token as said before amount of computational resources needed depends on complexity/predictability of the input he can sample the input and start to analyze how it is composed identify constant parts etc    for further reading on application of cryptographic hash functions the following wikipedia articles are relevant  cryptographic hash function   hash-based message authentication code   p.s.4 partial off-topic as mentioned earlier it can be easy for an attacker to extract the constant and generation code by attacking shared hosting environment  don t try to reinvent the wheel and don t try to reinvent a solution for unique random numbers if your language or framework provide a function to generate a random uuid a go with that you may know what you are doing but you have just you debugging and supporting the language or framework has a company or organization behind it to make sure that they get it right   no  i m not a php developer but i found this on the uniqid function you re using   uniqid manual page   warning   this function does not create random nor unpredictable strings   this function must not be used for security purposes  use a cryptographically secure random function/generator and cryptographically secure hash functions to create unpredictable secure ids  please refer to  this thread  on generating secure random numbers in php as it s beyond my scope and largely this is what your question boils down to  if you re getting 128 bits of entropy the encoding or putting it through further hash functions is largely unimportant  the accepted answer seems to be providing snake oil alongside good advice  for the generation of csrf tokens specifically there are only a few requirements   unpredictable  some resistance to brute force  uses printable characters that are compatible with web technology   all you need to do to achieve this is generate enough  cryptographically secure  randomness to prevent a modest brute force attempt compared to say offline password cracking and then base64 encode it  you can see what is used widely by the clojure community  https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-anti-forgery/blob/master/src/ring/middleware/anti_forgery.clj#l11  as part of the anti-forgery middleware prevents csrf     the key is that the   function being called here uses the cryptographically secure java   class under the hood the   refers to 60 bytes of random data to be base64 encoded  that s it  you can achieve the same outcome by sourcing random data from    here are problems with the other suggestions for the token generation algorithm   usage of   - don t use this at all it s not fit for purpose here and is  exactly  what the linked article in the accepted answer warns against but then the accepted answer goes on to use   in code examples...  usage of   - does not create unpredictable or random strings as per the php docs  using a hash function - does reduce the character set but doesn t add any security base64 encoding is clearer about the purpose and doesn t imply security functionality that simply isn t there  using a secret key - in other contexts secret keys are critical in this context it simply provides you with something you have to keep secret not an easy thing to do adding complexity and difficulty with no extra security benefit  adding client ip/port/etc - doesn t make the token more secure than crypto-random data but does make the algorithm more complicated and less portable  usage of microtime - doesn t add any extra security the current time is predictable enough to be brute forced if we consider   insecure then surely a timestamp is too   essentially anything you do that adds complexity without meeting the fundamental requirements just makes the algorithm   less maintainable  harder to understand  more likely to have a critical bug  less secure,would say interest articl similar topic would suggest use hash function add virtual secur make improv mention much effici e.g ad long random secret constant add secur secret constant remain secret -

76577,sse,0,0.46875,antimalware|antivirus,when is an antivirus program needed/useful,let s say i buy a computer and use the internet for services but rarely download anything and when i do it is from legitimate sources with a minimal to non-existent chance of malware   what benefits can an antivirus program provide me other than detecting or preventing those few downloads from containing malware?  or i guess more generally - is antivirus needed if a computer doesn t download files but only uses web applications,an antivirus program is always useful  the problem with your logic is that you re assuming that you are in control of everything that is downloaded to your machine  using web applications will invite all sorts of different possibilities into the mix   unknown downloads   lots of different things are downloaded to your machine without your knowledge  i just recently visited a site for holiday shopping and   was immediately downloaded to my machine without any kind of prompt  data masquerading as session cookies images all are downloaded without prompting to the user     but i don t run the browser as an administrator how can malware do any damage without privileges?   it turns out that malware really doesn t need very high privileges to get its job done  any kind of initial foothold into the system is all it needs to run rampant  it might not be super advanced and hard to remove  but the annoying adware types usually don t care all that much   browser exploitation   browsers are large applications with tons of attack vectors for exploitation  see  my answer here  that includes links to the main browser security bug fixes  you don t even need to visit a malicious site if an ad somewhere contains a piece of code to exploit the browser  in these cases files can be downloaded to your computer or browser extensions can be installed all without your knowledge or consent      web protection   nowadays antivirus products are a lot more than just scanning your system for malicious pieces of code  a lot of times now they provide real-time web browsing analysis  if a malicious script is running on a web page it will alert your first before displaying the web page itself    they can also scan for malicious urls and possible phishing attempts  just because it s displayed on google doesn t mean that you should click it  some phishers will do a lot to push their website up the chain of google returned searches    the bottom line is that there is a lot more out there to worry about than just downloading files when it comes to malicious pieces of code  using an antivirus program is always suggested better to have it and not use it than unprepared    in the year 2015 most malware will spread via two mechanisms the primary being usb or derivative which nearly all hardware is and the second being  tds  often a combination of adware parasite hosting and blackhat seo via exploit kits yes the second vector is over the web and the targets are browsers and browser plugins especially java flash and silverlight applets neither of these require you to download anything!  you can t stop either of the above attacks with antivirus however antivirus is still very important to have installed regardless there is one technique available via at least one free tool that i know about and one commercial product that provides near-complete control over infection this technique is exploit protection in the form of advanced canaries and aslr such as provided by microsoft emet or invincea freespace many in the security industry will claim that these can be bypassed -- and while there is truth to this it often requires knowledge of the target environment that goes beyond what exploit kits currently allow  let s pretend that you do have an advanced piece of malware that uses a hardware vector or an extremely-advanced web vector antivirus such as mcafee will not catch the malware -- but it can help a forensics investigation not only does mcafee leave behind  bup  files that can be analyzed it also can leave  event logs  or other artifacts that leave a trail of malware behaviors available to an investigator  summary install microsoft emet configure it for maximum security adding all of your browsers and browser plugins and advance its configuration further with tools such as  emetrules  also install antivirus -- my recommendation is mcafee because forensics investigators are familiar with it -- and it appears to be useful during after-the-fact investigations because of its logging capabilities if you are very worried about malware spread via hardware means then do not plug hardware such as usb any not just flash drives cd/dvd media or sdcards into your computer -- and protect your computer by removing or epoxying i.e gluing shut these hardware components  an antivirus  may  help against malware that exploit vulnerabilities to install themselves without user interaction like browser vulnerabilities pdf viewer ones flash player or java plugin ones in which case the antivirus would prevent the payload from executing  this of course assumes the payload is already known to the antivirus which isn t the case with a brand new virus or a targeted attack  since there are free and non-intrusive antivirus software such as microsoft security essentials you may as well install it every bit of protection helps  visiting shady websites and downloading files are common ways that a computer could get infected but they are by no means the only ones drive-by downloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the browser operating system or plugin flash java etc. can infect your computer if you merely  visit  a malicious webpage with no other interaction on your part and no indications that anything was downloaded  even big-name sites can sometimes spread malware for example earlier this year researchers found that some youtube ads were  linking users to drive-by downloads  and infecting anyone who clicked on them with a banking trojan the drive-by download relied on zero-day exploits in ie and flash so people who were infected would see no indication that anything malicious happened   then there are viruses that spread via infected usb flash drives over the local network etc etc in short visiting only major websites and downloading from legitimate sources will reduce your chances of getting malware but it does not mean that you can skip installing antivirus  of course you will always need an anti malware program even if you do not download files by yourself why ? because a simple visit to the most innocent website you know may trigger an attack and install you malware more likely spyware that can lead even to a total control of your machine  i advice you to read about  drive-by download  attacks that can exploit the vulnerabilities of your browsers and or their plugins and install without your consent or knowledge more or less dangerous malware     when is an antivirus program needed/useful?   as i said always unless if your computer is totally disconnected from internet and you never use any external media usb sticks external hdd cds ... to read  data in which case your computer is useless,antiviru program alway use problem logic assum control everyth download machin use web applic invit sort differ possibl mix unknown download lot differ thing

 my thought is to add another level of encryption -- e.g we have an additional public/private key pair and we encrypt all the information in the post by that as well  that would mean that an attacker who had compromised your ssl cert would need to find an additional private key in order to break the communication  thoughts,i m assuming when you say the web app sends a post what you really mean is that the html webpage in the users browser makes a post request to a third party server   the event of a ssl/tls compromise by an outside attacker rogue ca/government is probably pretty low  that leaves two possibilities  #1 your server was compromised through an unrelated attack and the private key was stolen  if someone is in your system and can access the private key they likely can access your application/source and modify it to siphon off data mitm  at that point no extra crypto will save you  #2  the settings used to create/deploy ssl/tls are bad.if you are using insecure algorithms/hashes or an old ssl version you may be vulnerable to ssl specific attacks  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport_layer_security#security   remember to use ssl 3/tls  preferably tls 1.2  instead of extra encryption if you  must  be secure use two-factor authentication make user users enter a user name a password and a 6-digit random number sent by email or sms a compromised certificate means that the attacker can possibly control the entire ssl payload both directions including any code you send to the client to perform the encryption required to authenticate with the server  also consider separating your application server and your authentication server this makes it a lot harder for an attacker to do anything useful with an acquired list of usernames and passwords if they are not actually accepted by the application server this is concept behind oauth2 it is far easier to recover one server than it is to attack two servers at least in theory  yes!  tls is  not  secure - certificate substitution is  extremely  common most businesses use content-inspection edge devices most schools and unis all good firewalls and even several  countries  all force users to install their own ca so they can mitm and inspect encrypted traffic  about every 2 months a new ca is found to have been compromised as well  there are also lots of malware that install their own ca on victim machines  using 2fa is not a solution for this problem 2fa is a 35-year-old  authentication tech which has nothing whatsoever to do with protection against traffic interception  if you are assuming the private key was compromised the certificate is given out with every transaction but is useless without the private key it would have had to have been at the bank if this is the case any other security mechanism provided by the bank is equally null-and-void  if you are assuming the browser or application has an additional ca authority as is often done by employers then essentially the client is compromised if you do not trust the list of cas why would you trust that the browser doesn t have any hooks - or for that matter a keylogger?  if this is done from an application you are writing you should be able to get the tls certificate for your connection this should be possible for java in a browser though apparently not from javascript you are still of course assuming that the application/java program hasn t been tampered with - there is no way to run trusted code on an untrusted platform  if you have a tls connection using diffie-hellman it is not possible to decrypt captured data even with the private key  citation  https://support.citrix.com/article/ctx116557     a man-in-the-middle attack will still work even for a diffie-hellman if the attacker has the private key and the certificate they are indistinguishable from the legitimate owner  my personal opinion is that if someone is tampering/trying to tamper with my data then i don t want another layer of encryption i want to be told and refused service  note also i have seen additional ca certificates installed by antimalware software so it can scan for malware delivered by https,instead extra encrypt must secur two-factor authent make user user enter user name password 6-digit random number sent email sms compromis certif mean attack possibl control entir ssl payload direct includ code send client perform encrypt requir authent server also consid separ applic server authent server make lot harder attack anyth use acquir list usernam password actual accept applic server concept behind oauth2 far easier recov one server attack two server least theori,,attacks|protection|antimalware|vulnerability|sensitive data|man in the middle|sensitive information,7,20,798,0.025062657000000002,6/2/2014 21:01,DH,Wants clarification about the security of POST over HTTPS,AT,Describes actions to ensure security. 
201163,sse,11,0.499851793,antivirus|defense|malware,explaining malware avoidance tactics,most how tos regarding malware list this   install antivirus software  install latest antivirus software  run antivirus software regularly  install latest operating system  install any patches to software  don t download random stuff and run it as an application like   files   i would like to know in a little more detail what all those first steps mean and what else could be included in this list for example littlesnitch blocks all outgoing and incoming traffic and lets you inspect it first that would be a good thing to do then there is potentially being alerted whenever a script tries to be invoked that you didn t write yourself or isn t installed from a trusted vendor i d like to know what other kinds of things you should do beyond this list to have an ideal security environment in regards to avoiding malware,all of the steps you listed can be boiled down into two simple rules    keep all software including av up to date    do not download and run anything you don t fully trust    now in more detail     install antivirus software   you should install antivirus software to detect and block the low hanging fruit i would recommend using windows defender which is built in to any modern windows system this antivirus used to be a lot worse and has gotten a bad reputation but nowadays it is fairly solid and is fine even on its own do be aware that antivirus is easy for malware authors to bypass it is only particularly effective against malware that is not new and which has already been around for some time     install latest antivirus software   using an outdated version of antivirus or antivirus database reduces its ability to detect new malware when malware is discovered in the wild antivirus vendors add its signature to a database this database must be kept up to date along with the rest of the antivirus av software often does this by itself     run antivirus software regularly   while av can sometimes detect malware when it executes it s often better to proactively scan your drive for potentially malicious executables most av software can be configured to run periodic scheduled scans if your av vendor does not do this you can configure it to do so     install latest operating system   generally the latest operating system is the most secure at the time of this post that would be windows 10 although there are legitimate privacy concerns with running windows 10 it is unarguably the most secure version of windows to date even without antivirus it contains sophisticated security mechanisms that make it more difficult for malware to get hold of the system through vulnerabilities     install any patches to software   all software has bugs sometimes these bugs can be exploited to infect your system this is even true for web browsers where a security bug could allow a web page to infect your computer even if you do not intentionally download and run any program when these bugs are discovered they are patched or fixed in order for this fix to be applied you need to keep your software up to date configure your operating system and all other software including your browser to automatically update itself     don t download random stuff and run it as an application like .exe files   if software you run doesn t have easily exploitable vulnerabilities you can still get infected by malware if you are tricked into running a malicious program be aware that not only   files can have viruses there are many dozens of formats which can be executed as such you should only ever download files from sources you absolutely trust otherwise you are opening yourself up for infection     i d like to know what other kinds of things you should do beyond this list to have an ideal security environment in regards to avoiding malware   there are a few other things you can do to keep your system secure beyond simply keeping your operating system and associated software up to date and not running software you don t trust    do not use an administrative account as your main account    set uac user account control to maximum security    do not install more programs than you need especially if you don t trust them    never run programs as administrator unless you are  absolutely  sure you can trust them    i wrote a bit about additional security measures you can take  in another answer  where i give specific methods that can be done in the case that you do not use antivirus that does not mean you cannot use the techniques  alongside  av software of course just that av does not obsolete them,step list boil two simpl rule keep softwar includ av date download run anyth fulli trust detail instal antiviru softwar instal antiviru softwar detect block
