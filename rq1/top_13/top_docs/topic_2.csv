13052,i m not really sure this can be called an answer but the problem no longer exists so here goes  after a week of fighting that rather odd issue i got pulled away on other tasks and could no longer focus on it  after two weeks i finally had time to resume looking into the problem and to my surprise it was no longer an issue  the .bat file is now launching correctly every time with no changes on my part  my best guess is that windows may have gotten stuck and some windows update caused a reboot sometime over the past two weeks causing things to start working  why i never tried a basic system reboot during all of my troubleshooting i don t know chalk that up to stupidity  on a side note if anyone else is struggling with a similar issue my next trouble shooting step was to create a custom .bat file with these contents   then insert a call to it in code right above the call to start the zap .bat file  just to see if the code could start anything at all or if it were something specific to the zap .bat file,2019-05-31 16:06:13.707 UTC,985,56398446,"i have been trying to get the  owasp zap tool  to run against my code in an automated fashion  i have been successful in writing a method that works consistently through the text explorer interface of visual studio 2017 on my local machine  however whenever i try to have one of my automated test boxes run it using the remote testing command line tool triggered by tfs then it always fails with code 1 and no other error text  i am running the same version of windows 10 locally and on the test box  i have the same version of visual studio installed on each so i would expect them to be using the same version of vtest to run the tests  i m not actually sure vtest is involved since i have converted to selenium and this is being run as a unit test anyway without a gui component  i have tried setting security on the .bat file and the .exe file it calls to authenticated users full access because i thought it could be a permissions issue  i have looked in the event log but there is are no details showing up in there it is like it never happened  i watch the test box while it is attempting to run this particular test and it never even tries to start up a separate command window for the new zap process it fails before that ever happens  however it is definitely finding the correct file to run on the test box because i have tried altering the url and get a specific error saying it can no longer be found  i have also tried manually executing the command i am trying to run via command line and when i do it manually on the test box then it works perfectly  the tfs box is logged in and running as the user i tried the manual test as and that user is a local admin on the box  because this works locally on my machine and because i am able to successfully run the command manually on the test box the problem component seems to be the tfs remote agent  the remote agent is successful in launching two other processes for selenium testing one of which is the ie driver and the other is the winappdriver the winappdriver has a separate command window associate with it when it launches  however both of these processes are launched by the selenium wrapper i am not launching the processes myself directly  you can see an excerpt below of the code i am using to launch the zap process  does anyone know why it might be failing on my best box?

44315,two-and-one-half years later ..  i converted a non-trivial standalone application that did not use mfc to a non-mfc dll that was intended to be loaded by an mfc program everything worked but the vs 2010 debugger reported endless memory leaks  the clue was that these memory leaks were being reported on exit  before  the dll cleanup functions were being called  there is a detailed discussion with an equally detailed and complex solution here   http://www.vis-sim.com/3dscenebb/viewtopic.php?t=1027   that involves specifying mfc library dependencies there is however a much simpler solution   in property pages->linker->input add your dll filename to delay loaded dlls  in the same dialog box tab add delayimp.lib to additional dependencies   a programmatic alternative along with a discussion of delay-loaded dll advantages and disadvantages can be found here   http://www.codeproject.com/articles/9428/delay-loading-a-dll   the advantage here is that the delay-loaded dll is unloaded before the mfc dll is unloaded and so mfc no longer reports false memory leaks  note that this only needs to be done for the debug version your dll in order to suppress the false memory leak messages the dll can still be statically linked in the release version thereby avoiding the disadvantages of delay-linked dlls  i believe it is simply a question of in which order somestring is initialized versus the call to afxenablememorytracking if i remember correctly in fact the memory leak probably happen in the other builds but somestring may have been allocated before the memory leak tracking was activated or it was released before the check happens unlikely nothing clear it in the sample   you can try to make the other build to show the leak by assigning a new value to somestring with a longuer string to be sure a new memory allocation is done do it from the simpledll s constructor but first you have to move the string declaration inside simpledll.cpp file otherwize you get a new instance into each .cpp that include someheader.h  edit it is not specific to mfc that would happens with any dll but as mfc automatically enable the memory leak detection it become more visible in mfc applications,2011-09-28 17:33:41.097 UTC,636,7587211,this may be better directed to microsoft support but was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to why this is happening  i created a simple c++ dll like the following   next i make a generic mfc sdi single document interface application using the default settings in vs 2010 in mainfrm.h i #include simpledll.h and create a member variable simpledll msimpledll  here s where it gets interesting if i compile both the dll and the mfc application targeting v100 both using the /mdd switch simply starting and then closing the application generates a memory leak if i change the use of mfc setting in the mfc app to use mfc in a static library the leak goes away then if i recompile the dll targeting v90 and recompile the mfc app using the dll version of mfc no memory leak switch the dll to use v100 and the mfc app to use v90 and no memory leak in fact the only combination that seems to generate a memory leak is when both the dll and the mfc app target v100 and the mfc app is using mfc as a shared dll i even tried this with the vs11 developer preview and when targeting v110 everything worked fine  has anyone run into this issue? is it limited just to the sdi mfc app in vs2010? what could be causing these leaks? i m assuming it has something to do with the dll being terminated prior to calling the destructor of the somestring constant but why would using mfc as a dll affect that,0.025157232704402517,16,so,c++|dll|memory-leaks|mfc|visual-studio-2010,why does my dll leak when using it in an mfc sdi program using mfc as a dll in visual studio 2010,1,memory leaks,0.44783782958984375

17562,ok i think the first point you re raising is that zap doesnt pick up that you ve tried an invalid password that is not a security risk - you supplied a bad password the app didnt let you in everything s working as it should  zap will only alert you of vulnerabilities via the active or passive scanners the fuzzer is for manual testing if we work out a way to automate the detection of a vulnerability then we put that in the active or passive scanners :so you have to interpret the fuzzer results rather than expect zap to do that for you.in any case successfully logging in is not a vulnerability in zaps terms  what the fuzzer will tell you is if the string you supplied was included in the response which is useful when looking for xsss the response code the time taken and the response length  when logging in i d expect that the response length would be significantly different so one option would be to look for a response with a length significantly different to the others  however the easiest option is probably to search the fuzz results.to do this go to the search tab select  fuzz results  in the pull down and either search for a string that you know will be shown when you successfully log in or do in inverse search for a string that you know will be shown when you fail to login  does that help?  note that we do have a load of info on the zap wiki including videos faqs and much more  http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/introduction   btw we do have a zap user group which is intended for exactly these sort of questions  http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-users you can also access it via the zap  online / zap user group  menu item.i try to keep an eye on forums but there are so many that some questions are bound to slip through  if anyone can suggest how i can convince people to use the zap user group which all the zap developers subscribe to instead of general purpose forums like this which is very useful for other questions then i d be very grateful :  simon zap project lead,2013-12-30 18:24:53.867 UTC,538,20845226,my scenario  i navigate to a login page.i put in a known username with a bad password.zap picks this up no issue  i select the post to the login page.i find the lines that contain the username and password  the password:ctl00%24contentplaceholder1%24cploginaspx%24ctl00%24logincontrol1%24ltlogin%24password=12345&amp  i highlight the 12345 and right click to select fuzz.i had put in a custom list with the correct password for the test account and i select that  when i do it works its way through the list as i expected  changing the 12345 to the various options in the list  but when it gets to the word i know is the correct password  it does nothing different to alert me that it was correct  the password in this case was password5  i expected that it would reflect or something showing it was directed to a new page  but that happens for  password  which is not correct for the test user  i see this in the fuzzer tab,0.040892193308550186,22,so,fuzzing|owasp|penetration-testing|security-testing|zap,owasp s zap and the fuzz ability,4,zap|owasp|vulnerability|penetration test,0.42708227038383484

9298,dll hijacking is really a simple concept  applications load external code via dlls dynamic link libraries dll highjacking is a process by which malicious code is injected into an application via a malicious dll with the same name as a dll used by the application  an application is vulnerable to dll hijacking depending on how they reference their dlls one example is using relative paths instead of the absolute path to the dll another is loading dlls using environment variables that may not be set properly in which case the directory defaults to a relative path of the executing application  the basics are simple windows has a search path for dlls much the same way it has a $path for finding executables if you can figure out what dlls an app requests without an absolute path triggering this search process you can then place your hostile dll somewhere higher up the search path so it ll be found before the real version is and windows will happilly feed your attack code to the application  so let s pretend your system s dll search path looks something like this   and some application foo.exe requests bar.dll which happens to live in the syswow64 d subdir this gives you the opportunity to place your malicious version in a b or c and it will be loaded into the app automatically whenever the app requests bar.dll and now your foo is well and trully bar d  as stated before even an absolute full path can t protect against this if you can replace the dll with your own version  and of course this isn t really limited to windows either any os which allows for dynamic linking of external libraries is theoretically vulnerable to this,2010-09-02 02:37:18.63 UTC,323,3623490,simple question what is dll hijacking?  i read a lot about which applications are vulnerable but not a lot of depth as to  why   answers appreciated,0.030959752321981424,10,so,dll|windows,what is dll hijacking,5,hijack|attacks|protection|vulnerability|malicious code,0.3958950936794281

42406,i hit the same symptom in the course of migrating an internal library from static linking to load-time dynamic linking and it turned out that the problem in my case was that the dll project and the exe project were linked to different versions of vc++ s runtime/mfc libraries one was mbcs and one was unicode  in my case the application and library were both using mfc and the _afx_debug_state destructor which activates the crt memory leak dump was being called twice for two separate objects -- since the dll and exe linked to different runtime dlls static state in the runtime was effectively duplicated one of the dlls would unload and dump leaks too early and show a bunch of false leaks switching both projects to use the same character set resolved the separate runtime linkage and also resolved the false leak reports  in my case linkage to the two separate runtimes was unintentional and may have caused other problems anyway this obviously wouldn t be the case when consuming third party libraries with a well-defined abi where you have no control over what crt the library is linked to  not sure if this would ve be applicable in your case but i wanted to post in case it s helpful to others  in mfc applications you can disable automatic memory leak dump by calling   this is supported since visual studio 2010 for the documentation see  here   i had the same problems in visual studio 2015 i tried all the solutions the first solution with fake-mfc-dependency only worked if you choose compiler option   in your dll so your dll and main application won t share the same heap but often   is needed e.g if you want to share stl container or string objects between the dll and your main application dll-boundary if   is used app and dll use the same heap so the first solution with fake-mfc-dependency didn t work for me  i don t like the second solution by disabling memory-leak-detection in the main application when you don t need the dll with this call in destructor anymore you have to remember to reactivate the memory-leak-detection in your application  i found another solution so i didn t have false-memory-leaks anymore.you only have to use the   linker option for your dll! that s all :- it worked for me also with compiler option     here  you can read something about dll-boundary why to use  ?.and  here  you can read something about crt compiler options in general  any of following solves the problem  1 create a fake dependency of the dll on mfc or  2 use the solution suggested by smerlin add this code next to dllmain   if you are calling   at the end of the main function the behaviour is expected since   will be deleted after   was called  you would need to call   after the last destructor of you static objects has been called or rather in the last destructor after the memory has been freed if you dont want to see these leaks quite difficult task i wouldnt try it  the cleaner approach is to allocate all your static objects on the heap instead at the beginning of   and deallocate them at the end of   and then you can call   and wont see any memory leaks  fyi static objects with constructors and destructors are considered bad anyways because the order in which they are constructed/desctructed is not deterministic and because of that static objects often introduce bugs which cant be debugged easily   edit regarding andrey s comment you could try to deactivate the automatic call to   by calling  _crtsetdbgflag  to unset the   flag if that works you can add a static object which calls   in its destructor to make sure that this object is destructed last you can use the  #pragma init_segcompiler directive   no clue if this will work .. other than that all other solutions will most likely require you to modify the itk library which should be possible it s a open source library after all?,2012-04-24 14:26:29.057 UTC,735,10299995,a follow-up question to  memory leaks when calling itk from visual studio dll   i refined the problem to the simplest example   when such a global class is defined in a dll visual studio debug crt reports that mp_data is leaked on application shutdown does anybody know a workaround except disabling leak reporting,0.02040816326530612,15,so,c++|memory-leaks|visual-studio-2010,vs2010 reports false memory leaks for static classes in a dll,1,memory leaks,0.38811376690864563

51395,the processexplorer handle leak reports are a symptom of an activation context leak most likely this leak is in your code indirectly in that you ve not correctly called mfc   to help yourself validate that this is your bug and not mfc s you can create a simple mfc dll from the appwizard without any of your code and confirm that when it is loadlibrary/freelibrary several times there is no accumulative leak   the missing os call is either a releaseactctx or a missing deactivateactctx that caused the release to fail in practice mfc is calling these functions for you so you ll be looking for a missing mfc call of some kind  the best debugging technique would probably be to trace or breakpoint the core activation context create/activate/deactivate/release functions http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374166vs.85.aspx and see what happens you may see a bunch of calls so some kind of tracing may be necessary ideally you might capture the callstack at each call and review them your debugger may be able to help you do this recent versions of vs can run macros when they hit breakpoints  as an aside you are correct that you need the manifest files and should not remove them   martyn  does your dll use mfc by any chance?i had an issue with an dll which uses mfc and calls   which might be related this dll erroneously called   repeatedly and it turned out it leaked an activation context for each of these calls surprisingly this only happened when the calling application used a manifest     the processexplorer handle leak reports are a symptom of an activation context leak most likely this leak is in your code indirectly in that you ve not correctly called mfc    it is not related to specific code usage the issue has been confirmed by microsoft  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2624911   there is indeed a context activation leak in the shell32.dll when calling unregisterclass affecting windows vista and up the only work-around to the issue is to not repeatedly load and unload shell32.dll microsoft is looking at a fix for this issue in newer versions of windows  these handles may be not leaked -- just cached if you change your test program to load and unload your dll repeatedly several times do you see a new pair of handles leaked every time dll unloads? if not it s not an issue,2010-07-04 04:41:45.16 UTC,568,3173739,i have a dynamically loaded &amp unloaded dll which requires comctl32.dll >= v6.0 and msvcr >= v9.0 to ensure that the correct versions are loaded i enable manifest file generation in visual studio project setting and add this entry to another manifest file     in a test program i call   followed by   of that dll and processexplorer indicates that the following file handles were leaked   c:\windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.1_x-ww_6f74963e  c:\windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.2600.5512_x-ww_35d4ce83   from disassembly call stack trace i learnt that on   an activation context was automatically created and it opens handles to each of these folders but it appears that the activation context is not deleted on    if i remove the manifest files and set project settings to disable manifest generation these leaks are gone however that way i will be unable to ensure that the correct msvcr and comctl are used since this dll is loaded by processes i have no control over  is there a way to remove this leak  without removing the manifest files ?  thanks,0.028169014084507043,16,so,c++|dll|handle|memory-leaks|windows,file handle leak on dynamically loaded dll caused by activation context,1,memory leaks,0.3871352970600128

40021,below i will present some different approaches you can use to find your leaks  there are commercial leak detectors available should you not wish to follow the diy approach  link to my answer detailing lots of debugging tools/resources    how to use windbg to analyze the crash dump for vc++ application?    load sos.dll into windbg  you actually don t need visual studio to use sos.dll....it s a debugger extension so can be used in windbg too  you can get the windbg debugger free as part of the debugging tools for windows  you could then write a windbg script to automate your dumps  also be aware there are enhanced versions of sos.dll available...look for sosex psscor2 for net 2 and psscor4 for net 4  clr profiling api  you can use the clr profiling api  there s an application called clrprofiler which is an actual .net profiler that makes use of it....so a good bit of code to see how it s used  one of the things clr profiler can do is allow heap dumps to be made and then compare those dumps made at different time periods to find the differences...and thus help find leaks  you could provide similar functionality to your application when in a test mode either embedded in the application or as a companion utility to monitor it     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc300553.aspx      http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=16273      http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davbr/     process dumps  another technique you can use is to take periodic dumps of your process which you can then analyze offline via windbg with sos/sosex or any other windbg plugin  you can use debugdiag you can set up rules and actions to control when .dmp files are created to automate the creation of .dmp files....or a tool called procdump.exe from sysinternals     http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26798      http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx     procdump is particularly useful because it is able to take the process snapshot very quickly because it uses a technique called process reflection....this enables your process to be interrupted less aggressively e.g  create 3 dumps with 5 seconds gap between each one   post-mortem analysis  after you have a set of .dmp files you can then analyze them to find leaks monitor handle usage etc  you can manually load the .dmp files in windbg and then issue debugger commands or you could write a windbg extension or maybe a script which took the set of dump files and processed them in turn i.e ran the !dumpheap stat command on them   debug analyzer .net    http://www.debuganalyzer.net/    this is a tool aimed at analyzing .dmp files and doing post-mortem analysis  it lets you write scripts in .net so is maybe more accessible than windbg  it also has a plugin model if you want to extend it  and it lets your write/use visualizers to view the data in unique ways  currently only supports clr 2.0 memory dumps...not clr 4.0,2012-08-31 21:48:02.287 UTC,716,12222873,in order to track down memory leaks i have been using visual studio and sos.dll to provide dumps of the object heap and to see what is gcrooting a particular object in place  i started automating this process using autoit to control my mouse and keyboard  here is an approximation of the first part of my script     in visual studio press f5 to start execution   let the program fully load   switch to visual studio and break execution        switch focus to the immediate window   load sos.dll   call     copy the result of the dump to the clipboard   paste in notepad and save as dump1.txt        resume execution   perform the leaky action a number of times   switch to visual studio and break execution        switch focus to the immediate window   clear the output   call     copy the result of the dump to the clipboard   paste in notepad and save as dump2.txt        run a python script which compares the two dumps and locates leaked objects   i have a few concerns with my current method though  not only am i dependent on an installation of visual studio but while the script is running i cannot use the mouse or keyboard without throwing the automation out of sequence  is there a way to use sos.dll within a c# program rather than visual studio?  ideally this solution would attach to a specified process and output the result of   to a text file without the need for automating visual studio,0.0111731843575419,8,so,.net|c#|debugging|memory-leaks|sos,how can i use sos.dll within a c# program for automated debugging purposes,1,memory leaks,0.38686978816986084

45121,there are a number of things you can do to start diagnosing this issue firstly you say that only one app is doing this so this would indicate that the problem is an app problem rather than xcode this is a good thing :-  next i would start using the profiler to monitor the memory and allocated objects in the app try taking snap shots of the memory at regular intervals and look at what has been allocated since the prior snap shot the profiler can then help you to dig down into the leaking objects and see where they are being retained and released this might give you the clue you need  another thing is try is the profilers leaks monitoring that also might tell you whats going on inside your app   lastly is there anything in your code that is executing in some sort of loop something that animates on the home screen for example perhaps that is leaking  you don t happen to have    turned on? that is know to be causing memory issues exactly as you described  thanks very much to drekka &amp adrian b for your speedy answers but as always happens as soon as i post a question i stumble across some information that leads to an understanding &amp in this case partial solution  looking for an answer to a different question i came across a thread on the apple developers forum where several others are reporting the same issue  it is related to the use of the spritekit scene editor  hence it is app related in that for me it occurred with the only app for which i have ever used the scene editor but in reality it is an xcode bug  what happens is that if the scene editor window is open i.e the .sks file is selected even if the scene is blank xcode starts to leak memory at a rate of about 1mb/sec  if you close that window the leakage stops  it happens even if xcode is minimized  apparently it has been reported as a bug i guess the work around for now is to accept the leakage while you re modifying your scene &amp then close the editor when you ve finished or do everything in code  cheers  rb,2016-04-07 02:44:59.27 UTC,589,36465814,i am writing a game in swift using spritekit with xcode 7.3 on a mac mini running el capitan both updated in last couple of days  shortly after i started my mac mini started crashing the error log indicated that a kernel panic had occurred likely due to a memory leak &amp the process was identified as xcode looking at the activity monitor i can see that when this specific app is loaded in xcode the memory used by xcode fairly rapidly increases even though the app is just sitting there doing nothing  when other apps are loaded &amp idle the memory usage stays more or less constant as you would expect i have googled for clues for several hours but can find only info about memory leaks when an app is running &amp how to detect them with instruments  this is a weird one as far as i m concerned  i do not have any idea how to start to figure out what s causing this other than starting with a fresh project &amp gradually adding code to see if/where it starts happening again  i would appreciate any ideas other xcode users may have,0.01697792869269949,10,so,ios|memory-leaks|xcode,why is ios app causing memory leak in xcode when idle,1,memory leaks,0.36200830340385437

2742,there are two types of linking static linking and dynamic linking   dll hijacking  is when a malicious program takes advantage of dynamic linking  for dynamic linking to work there needs to be a list of paths to find the shared library that is being linked   in windows  there are various ways for the search path to be affected  but there is generally an order in how the search is performed and most applications don t provide a fully qualified path e.g   for the shared object that they plan to load    what happens is an attacker will place a dll of the same name in a location searched before the location of the legitimate dll  for instance lets say the search path when attempting to load   is first   and then    the application simply calls      as long as the attacker has their version of   in   their version will get loaded not the legitimate version  this can be mitigated by providing a fully qualified path to the library you re loading   static linking means that the entire library was built into the application  an entire copy is kept by the application and all function addresses to that library are resolved at compile time  which means that there is no searching for the library and an attacker can t replace the library itself  the downside to this is that the application becomes enlarged by the size of the library and updating the library itself means that the entire application needs to be updated  in this case dll hijacking does not work,2014-12-14 12:52:51,296,75938,i was wondering if dll hijacking would work with all types of linking or just run-time linking i hear that malware uses it and wanted to know how it works,0.030405405405405407,9,sse,malware|programming,would dll hijacking work with load-time linking,3,hijack|malware|attacks,0.36091190576553345

11202,many honest developers have problems because of careless antivirus software see this also  how to prevent false positive virus alarm on my software?   imagine that for each false positive they show you lose a possible customer programmers should  take action  against such antivirus products and force them to be more careful about false positive alarms even to get some revenue back for the sales we lose because of them   update recently i have observed that     number of false positives on virustotal.com is much higher when the program is compiled is  release mode  with compiler optimizations then when it is compiled in  debug mode     detection sky rockets when eurekalog is used       so submit to virustotal before you publish your program!   update 2019 unfortunately innosetup is not spared also i created a dummy installer with innosetup and upload it on virustotal 5 out of 52 programs  reported  a false positive! update on update now the number of false positive extended to 9!  it is surprisingly common that delphi applications are reported as potentially harmful by av applications it happened to me a while ago using delphi 2009 see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:reference_desk/archives/computing/2010_march_20#delphi.2favg_issue   at so we also have    virus in delphi 7    accidentally created a virus?    and many more  it might be the actual  induc virus  but most likely it is a false positive  there are several reasons why an anti virus product might trigger on a delphi produced exe a few common reasons are   lots of viruses are written in delphi and therefore your exe might have some code parts that look the same as existing viruses  the import table of your program is used to determine what your exe  might  do for instance linking to credentials management or disk management functions triggers some av s   as suggested before try scanning your release version with online services such as  virustotal  or  jotti  and always report your false positives to vendors instead of trying to prevent being a false positive my experience is that av vendors react quite fast on submission  as a solution you may want to    1 - verify your delphi compiler is not infected 2 - verify your sources and libraries are not tempered with that was the m.o for the  induc   virus  3 - check your guaranteed clean exe with the avs if they report a false positive contact them so they could fix their tests    4 - if you need to distribute before there is a chance to correct the avs sign your exe so that your users could verify it s clean  andreas s answer is excellent it just happens a lot to delphi applications  signing code doesn t make any difference -- i ve had nod32 throw false positives on signed delphi code  if there were any techniques that would avoid false-positives virus authors will use them to avoid detection  i ve found the best course of action is unfortunately reactive rather than proactive  all av vendors have a facility to report false positives and i ve found them to be responsive to reports  in free pascal/lazarus groups and bugtracker such messages happen nearly every release and/or month  we generally advise users to ignore all generic or heuristic scanning types and stick to signature based scanning as most corporate virusscanners do   this because it is nearly always an heuristic alarms never specific malware this can be readily seen in the fact that the detected virus/trojan is nearly always of the generic type usually the virusscanners are also typical home virusscanners or home editions of general virusscanners norton used to be particularly bad nowadays it mostly the smaller scale cheap home use scanners  however we communicate mostly with developers and already have trouble getting this message across i can imagine when distributing to clueless end-users this is a real difficult message to communicate  still there is no other way,2010-07-26 21:28:19.057 UTC,815,3339136,i just ran into an annoying problem    suddenly  avira antivir  started to flag one executable from my software as being a virus   as the default action from almost any user is to click ok and avira suggests to put the  virus  in quarantine most of my users are deleting this executable    well let s not be arrogant and check if i m not infected indeed i posted the file to  http://www.virustotal.com  and from all anti virus only avira flags it as infected furthermore i scanned my computer with two different anti viruses and it is clean  i already posted a mail to my users explaining what is happening but this is an overhead to my support that i really don t want    ok the question is is there a way to avoid this kind of behavior? i can t think any way else than signing the files don t really know if it would solve but let s see if you have any creative idea,0.03558282208588957,29,so,antivirus|delphi|delphi-7|executable|false-positive,antivirus false positive in my executable,3,virus|trojan|malware,0.3507283627986908

 at some point the bug will stop happening and you ll know what bit of code was responsible  however depending on your code base it s not always easy to remove code and still have something that you can test i.e without crashing the application  when it comes to fixing memory leaks there are two steps    finding where the memory leak is  fixing the memory leak   normally the first step is tricky so i would recommend to go ahead with ants memory profiler and first find  what exact instances are growing    profiling an asp.net application on iis   in your question you have shown the class list result which includes even classes with system namespace to clean up the noise you can select show only classes with source option       then follow the follwing steps   take a base snapshot before you perform any operations  perform the operations you suspect that have memory leaks  take couple of more snapshots until you get a fairly stable snapshot  compare the last snapshot with the base and see what instances are growing   in your analysis i see that the .net analysis is not done correctly are you doing analysis in the same machine where you have captured the memory dump ?     for debugdiag to work correctly you have to have the same version of  .net framework of the application installed on the analyzing machine  as well   also please do not do native memory leak dump like  this  ,unless it is not figured out unmanaged leak.from the analysis of yours it looks like this is managed leak     when you changed the web.config file,it causes an application domain  unload and reload   let s do step by step   using debugdiagcapture consecutive hang dumps  launch  debugdiag collection  and go to the processes tab     start your stress test   check the memory usage and once it reaches say 1 gb,capture a hang dump      right click on the w3wp.exe process   choose the option create full memory dump              capture another dump at 2 gb and one at 3.5 gb  you should have dumps captured in the folder c:\programfiles\debugdiag\logs\misc\  right click on the dump file and choose the option analyse .net memory issue           now compare the analysis of each dump file1 gb,2 gb 3.5 gb it  should tell you which .net objects are increasing and not getting  garbage collected   in the memory analysis you should see  clr information****,.net gc heap information   most memory consuming .net objects  etc like below this will come if your .net symbols are correctly identified by debugdiag analysis   debugdaig automated analysis should give following   **errors or warnings **- pay close attention to warning or errors displayed by debugdiag analysis on the top of the report    .net gc heap information  -  total commit size   - this will roughly equal to your .net memory usage   40 most memory consuming .net object types  -this can be used to compare against your memory increase in consecutive dumps this will tell you which objects are causing issue.sometimes some objects you are not using at all will be coming and might be coming from some third party library.or you will see objects which you yourself have created    top objects in the finalizer queue   - this will give you any clue if your finalizer may be blocked .objects.some similar issues are discussed  here  and  here     objects on the large object heap  - this causes memory fragmentation and large object heap contaisn objects which are more than 85k in size   size of cache datatables,application domains,dynamic assemblies etc  it s not a good idea to have large number of application domain in one process   please note that sometimes the debugdiag automated analysis cannot figure out the root cause and needs manual analysis using windbg debugdiag analysis,please refer this  video   hope this helps",2017-06-26 12:22:51.413 UTC,1196,44759636,"i have a web application that i wrote using a lot of different 3rd party components a cms and of course my code for some reason i get out of memory exception     script threw an exception out of memory   i tried to find out what is going on this is what i ve found    i ran the test with 50 threads to call 15 pages of my web-application memory seems fine the iis process is using only 400 mb of ram    i ve added a space in web.config and suddenly my iis process started to grow to more than a gb in 30 minutes.visual studio could not take snapshot of my memory since it is too big really?! so i ve installed ants memory profiler but it says that my application is using only around 300 mb       iis process takes 1 gb     py.png  i stopped the test after some minutes but the memory has not released  ants profiler stopped working so i ve restarted it              it doesn t seem like the application is using 100-200mb memory specially that i am using output caching for my controllers what i don t understand is why memory consumed by iis is growing all the time  and what is wrong   update  my application has been restarted automatically with a crash in w3wp causing iis to release the memory while my stress was not running for a while     application w3wp.exe  framework version v4.0.30319  description the process was terminated due to an internal error in the .net runtime at ip 5a3a86f1 5a0f0000 with exit code 80131506   and      faulting application name w3wp.exe version 10.0.15063.0 time stamp 0xacce422f  faulting module name clr.dll version 4.7.2098.0 time stamp 0x59028d36  exception code 0xc0000005  fault offset 0x002b86f1  faulting process id 0x50a4  faulting application start time 0x01d2ee688f323893  faulting application path c:\windows\syswow64\inetsrv\w3wp.exe  faulting module path c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v4.0.30319\clr.dll  report id 4362ddc5-f8d7-4441-8916-3830f9268b3a  faulting package full name   faulting package-relative application id         update 2  i ran debugdiag and i ve stress tested the site until it consumed around 3.5 gb of my ram       and chakra is a microsoft s library           so now i have 2 questions   is it the chakracore that has leak or is it the one that is using/allocating it?

12052,answer  how recognize memory leak  lags on app - not best and safe answer you should monitor your diagnostic statistic on azure portal more info here -  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/   how catch dump from azure web app  every azure web app has it s own sandbox - an environment you can access it with .scm suffix for example if you site domain is   latvianmarksman.azurewebsites.net   then your sanbox address   latvianmarksman.scm.azurewebsites.net  .you should pass your azure credentials to login.on azure web app sandbox you can find different usefull info     tools > support  you can find here events diagnostic graphs andmake current memory dump analyze > metrics azure will spent sometime for getting dump and make simple analyze you can downloaddump and analyse report on analyze > diagnostics page     debug > cmd  you can find any local file of your web app usefullwhen you write your custom logs locally or when you have problemswith web app size     proccess exporer  this tab can give you information about mainproccesses of web app sandbox also on this tab you can get anddownload dump too     site extentions  you can install different site extentions forreserach your problem     tools > diagnostic dump  third way to make dump    what to do with azure web app dump  when your problem is simple - you can find answer in web app events or in simple dump analize;but to solve more complex problems you should make real deep dump analyze.the most forward and right way use win dbg  firstly lets talk about alternative sources of information   you can take chopped but sometimes usefull info from azure analyze report download in tools>support tab near dump lynk  debugdiag2 - good tool for downloaded dump analyzing  also you can use ms visual studio to get simple analyze of dump.  you can analyze only managed memory  you can analyze only on professional or enterprise version of ms studio not free community    azure web app diagnostics only azure web app counters info.  azure refreses this counters not so frequently  azure gives approximate information    azure sql diagnostics only azure sql counters info.  azure refreses this counters not so frequently  azure gives approximate information  if you need counters values right now use next script       but anyway the most full information about memory leaks of any difficulty you can catch using windbg;this tool combines high level interface and low level analyzing powerwindbg uses a lot of libraries but the most important of them:-netext  what should we do with dump    understand which memory managed or unmanaged leaks      managed memory leaks  usually means garbage collector problems when objects doesn t destructs correctly on this leaks you will find a lot of objects in high level cache       unmanaged memory leaks  usually means uncorrect release of unmanaged resources on this leaks you will find irregular use of heap;just dowload azure dump analyze and find gc section and heap sections analyze them and specify leak type;if it managed memory leak or you don t understand it type - go to 2 pointor go to 3 point if it unmanaged memory leak     analyze managed memoryuse ms visual studio if you have professional or enterprise version debug managed memory you can find which objects uses the most managed memory if you don t have ms visual studio pro or enterprise - try to use azure analyze report use standart windows dump analyze debugdiag2 or use windbg;all windbg info in the internet is about managed memory analyze for example: https://stackify.com/using-windbg-to-analyze-net-crash-dumps-async-crash/     analyze unmanaged memoryit is really difficult to find any info about this memory leak type.windbg can help us here too you can read really cool article about it here  http://kate-butenko.blogspot.ru/2012/07/investigating-issues-with-unmanaged.html     my windbg help file    set symbols         load netext lib      index dump file      get netext command list offcourse use your path      get heap info all objects >2mb      get heap info all objects >2mb write results in file      fix problems if you have them with symbols load        get objects info      get gc info managed memory analyze      p.s  and for desert what problem we had in our app?   it was unmanaged and managed memory problem simultaniously  in managed memory we just had a lot of objects of one type we have used signalr in our project so it was signalr objects in top of high level cashe objects that gc doesn t clean offcourse a lot of time we thinked that it is signalr problem internal or in our code but fixing all issues with signalr use doesn t help app crashes happen rarely but it does happen sometimes application just overflow memory and that s all so after hours of research i ve stumbled on article about unmanaged memory after next few hours i ve found kates article  so then i have found that we also had heap memory overflow so when i dip into heap using windbg i have found chars like that s.y.s.t.e.m..t.h.r.e.a.d.i.n.g..e.x.c.e.p.t.i.o.n.just standart exception text string many many exception thread strings we use log4net logging for server exceptions so the problem was that signalr in some cases cyclically spams server with 500 so log4net trying to write this stacktrace into log and overflows server + stacktraces keeps managed memory objects so you have problems in both memory types.fixing that cases kick off memory leaks so i sleep very well now   i hope that this info was usefull for you no leaks no headache sleep well repeat,2017-12-18 22:21:19.897 UTC,1077,47877265,question:on one of my web projects i ve come across some difficult problem on web app.we have used azure web app services for our system and once upon a time we have catch the most headache for any big app - memory leak.when you work with simple desktop app or publish your app on virtual machine - there are a lot of different ways - how to catch leak.you can install different monitor and diagnose solutions and catch it in real time  but what you should do when you work with azure web app?

27886,tl;dr  it is probably nothing but notify qt anyway and check your own systems  are you using the prebuilt qt binaries or are you compiling the sources yourself? if you are using the official prebuilt binaries i d of course expect that the qt devteam scans them and verifies that they don t accidently spread malware but there is always the miniscule chance of something slipping through same goes for the sources - while their review process should be thorough enough to avoid malicious code being slipped in there is still the outside chance of either a key account being compromised or even more unlikely bad code being added slice-by-slice over a longer time period to avoid detection along the lines of the underhanded c contest still either case seems to be rather unlikely   bottom line  while this does sound like and probably is a  false positive  you still may want to raise an issue with qt e.g on the their  bugtracking site  or directly with  qt support  if you have a commercial license to be sure also if you didn t do that already verify that the problem is not on your end e.g that your computers are clean and that you don t just randomly catch/detect your infection in that file   update  a  ticket concerning this issue  was opened i assume by ludek vodicka on qt bugtracker opened on nov 19th and categorized as p1 critical but unfortunately no indication that it is actually being worked on at least of dec 18th,2019-11-18 11:45:02,368,58913842,today we received info from one of our customer about this malware detection  gen:variant.adware.kazy.795337  it s only inside the qwebp.dll file attached to our project by qtdeploy process  we re building 32-bit qt 5.13.2.0 from the source and the same issue is reported on the same dll no matter where it was built we re using the latest vs 2019      https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9f09c05803ad4ffcd99454c420a840e17549ee711690fb1f11fd1b59bccc3b23/detection      https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/80c4c747d781a27c72de71c0900ccc045aefd2b4e4f17c949aaeeb3d0b7973b1/detection     when i scanned the older version 5.13.0.0 everything is ok  previous versions seem to be clean     https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b7b7cacaef0e76439ef8c367c401524e93dfa00c9ca67a20290e829fec325a5a/detection    also any debug build and 64-bit builds are clean too  any idea what can cause this? can anyone else please try to scan this file?  thanks,0.021739130434782608,8,so,malware|qt,qt 5.13.2.0 possible malware variant.adware.kazy.795337 in qwebp.dll,3,virus|malware|malicious code,0.3148379325866699
34585,this is not really something to worry about in terms of being an actual leak as it probably isn t i.e a false-positive the real problem is that this compromises your ability to diagnose your own memory leaks as they could get lost with these false-positives     why is this happening?   this kind of leak is quite common i usually work with qt + linux kde for gui applications and i see very similar leaks all the time the problem is that within any gui software you will have at least these layers your application the gui library the os kernel libraries and the graphics drivers in my experience most of the reported leaks come from the graphics driver presumably because that kind of low-level code requires a number of hacks that can be seen or detected as memory leaks by typical memory diagnostic tools like valgrind or whatever you are using a similar argument can be made with os kernel code although in my experience there are much fewer leaks coming out of there i m think they might be putting a bit more effort into avoiding these hacks in gui libraries qt win32 api etc. there are often similar leaks too for similar reasons it is of course not excluded that there could be an actual leak in any of those layers but you have to work under the presumption that there is none and the fact that the memory consumption stabilizes after some time indicates that it probably is no real leak at least not any that could do damage like runaway memory consumption btw this behavior of memory consumption that increases and then stabilizes is perfectly normal it has to do with heap-fragmentation that grows and eventually reaches equilibrium     how to eliminate these small memory leaks?   you can t really eliminate those leaks especially if you really don t have anything to do with them i.e they are coming out of the gui library stack not from your application the best you could do is report those diagnostics to whoever is in charge of support and maintenance of those libraries e.g microsoft but it is likely to be ignored or deemed to be a normal occurrence not really a leak  now to the real problem if you want to diagnose your own potential memory leaks then you will have to find a systematic way to circumvent or ignore the leaks coming from the gui library stack here are a few typical solutions   check for leaks often and avoid doing the things e.g resizing that increases the number of false-positives learn to know your leaks in the sense that by checking often you will become familiar with the leaks that come out of the gui library stack and be able to ignore them or subtract them from the diagnostics and only see the real leaks  use filtering tools to filter the output of your memory diagnostic tool most tools to check for leaks will have filtering options to filter out or to silence warnings or errors coming out of certain libraries or functions you can use those to silence the false leaks detected in these third-party libraries but be careful not to filter too much e.g like filtering out all leaks coming from the crt you should remain conservative you can even introduce deliberate memory leaks in your code to check that they don t get filtered out  modularize your application such that most of the important code the heavy-lifting code can be run in a simpler command-line program in other words make the gui into a simple front-end which is easy to make leak-free that uses some heavy-lifting back-end code you can transplant that back-end code into a much simpler command-line program and thus avoiding the gui library stack completely and allowing you to check for memory leaks more effectively without all the pollution this is the recommended solution for any serious project and it also fosters good coding practices unit-testing modularized code minimal inter-dependencies etc,2013-12-18 17:32:05.347 UTC,928,20664677,introduction and relevant information  the original project i work on has small memory leaks so i have decided to perform a small test so i can detect what could cause them  i have created a win32 project using visual studio wizard. i haven t added anything  i have just left it as it was created with the wizard.i have used the tool     http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/gdi_handles.html   to see if there are any inherent    problem  each time i resize the window this tool shows that there are +3 regions that my application leaks  my efforts to solve the problem  since the project was made by the visual studio wizard i have tried to create a simple project from scratch but the same +3 regions appear  reading through some articles on  codeproject  about regions i have stumbled upon some demo applications that demonstrate the usage of them  when i turn on   these applications also leak +3 regions  all of this is verified when i turn on   to see if the small memory leak is really occurring-it does occur since the  memory slightly rises  and  stays constant afterwards  no matter how many times i resize the window  i use microsoft visual studio 2008 express edition but the problem was detected when empty project is created in regular visual studio 2008 as well  i work on windows xp but the same effect happens on windows 7  question  why is this happening and how to eliminate these small memory leaks?

45771,it s a bug in java the bug ticket is here  http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8168069   many thanks to  mjiderhamn on github  he is the developer of the great  classloader-leak-prevention  library and has now included a preventor for this issue version 2.1.0     why is there a invalid certificate   the issuer alternative name extension value of the cert in the key store is empty which does not follow the x.509 specification  see section 4.2.1.6 and 4.2.1.7 of rfc 5280,2016-09-28 07:47:03.473 UTC,614,39741147,i ve analyzed a classloader leak the last few days in a large application and i ve worked out the problem  my application uses solrj which will be initialilzed through a  -method   solrj   uses the apache httpclient   the httpclient initializes the ssl context by using normal java classes like  .in this way java loads the trustmanager and analyzes all trusted certificates if there is an error the certificate an instance of   is stored in a list and gets enriched by the thrown exception.this exception is swallowed and my application remains unaware  as far as i can see the ssl context is in the system / root classloader my application is in the dedicated   and this is the problem because now there is an   inside of the ssl context which contains references in the stacktrace backtrace and so on to classes in my application  but now i don t know where this came from is it the solrj client the apache httpclient java itself the jvm or is it my application?  i have made a small application to reproduce the problem which you can find here  https://github.com/cpts/solrj-classloader-leak this also contains a workaround a shutdown hook which removes the references which leads to the classloader leak  if you disable the shutdown hook e.g by commenting it out and start a clean tomcat see environment to reproduce below you can reproduce it by following this steps   deploy the war of the demo project a  reload it b  reload it again c  trigger gc d  undeploy  trigger gc e  see that the metaspace gets not completly cleaned up f        i ve create a heap dump and the  shortest path to gc  looks like this       this was the same as in my large application.the mentioned workaround a little bit inspired by  https://github.com/mjiderhamn/classloader-leak-prevention  but this unfortunately doesn t solve my problem searches by using reflection for these   and removes the exception stored in the   field through this way   ->   ->   ->   ->   ->   ->    by doing this i ve got the stacktrace of the exception if it helps someone   my workaround solves the problem for now but of course this is just a workaround  i want to know and maybe someone can answer one or more of my question   is this a  bug  in solrj httpclient java or my application?  if it is my application what i am doing wrong?   if it is not my application is it a known problem? i can t find any information about this where should i create a bug ticket?  why is there a  invalid  certificate? btw maybe the leak would also be solve if i remove this certificate from the trust store.. i haven t tested but i think a invalid or damaged certificate should never lead to a classloader leak...  has anyone some more information on this? i can t belive that i m the only one who detect this behaviour except it is my appication.. see my question 2   at last but not least my environment to reproduce   tomcat version apache tomcat/8.0.14 debian  jvm version 1.8.0_91-b14  jvm vendor oracle corporation  os name linux  os version 3.16.0-4-amd64  architecture amd64,0.014657980456026058,9,so,apache-httpclient-4.x|java|memory-leaks|solr|ssl,classloader leak because of invalid ssl certificate in solrj httpclient jvm or my application,1,memory leaks,0.30786842107772827

22989,not seen that issue before but this link: https://github.com/spiderlabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/155 seems to suggest that upgrading to the latest owasp crs resolves the issue  the latest rule set is here  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/category:owasp_modsecurity_core_rule_set_project   the only difference i can see between 2.2.8 version you are running and the latest 2.2.9 version is that it also excludes _pk_ref cookie in that rule doing a quick search on google suggests that is used by piwik.org - an analytics tracking tool presumably similar to google analytics if you are using that software then that might explain this otherwise i can see no reason why upgrading to the latest rule set would resolve the issue then again i don t know why you would want to run the old version the owasp rules so might as well upgrade and see if that helps   disabling rules   if that doesn t resolve it then you can also disable the rule to do that you should not edit the original file but instead add the following to your config after the rule is defined perhaps in your own modsec_customisations.conf file   this is better then editing the actual file as when you upgrade the rules e.g going from version 2.2.8 to 2.2.9 as i m suggesting then you don t lose your customisations   risk of disabling rules   as to the risk of disabling the rule well this rule protects against cookies with multiple special characters sending of special characters in cookies are rarely security risks in themselves but may be attempts to circumvent other rules e.g you can hide sql injection attempts in cookies by escaping or by double escaping characters so other rules don t recognise the sql injection but because the escape characters may be resolved by your server programs they would still cause problems  it s important to realise that neither modsecurity nor the owasp crs that you can use to configure it will 100% protect your website they are designed to reduce the risk using known signatures they can check with rules there are a lot of rules in the owasp crs and not all may be appropriate for your website obviously the more of these rules you turn off the less you may be protected but that doesn t mean you shouldn t turn off rules where appropriate part of installing modsecurity is tuning and tweaking the ruleset including turning off rules were appropriate as long as you understand the rules you are tweaking then you need to make the judgement call as to whether that s appropriate,2015-07-31 22:52:19.837 UTC,515,31756344,i setup a new ssl certificate on my apache server and now when i try to access my website from   i get the error message  .from the apache log file i get   this is the line 157 of the above file   so i tried to disable   and indeed after it works fine   since i need to keep   enabled how can i fix this problem?    update   i edit the file   and i delete the line 157 now it works but what about the risk,0.027184466019417475,14,so,apache|mod-security|ssl,ssl on apache doesn t work when mod_security enabled,4,owasp|weakness|protection|sql injection,0.30131179094314575

42458,in order to avoid the exception memoryleak trap you could try to put an try/except around the foobarproc maybe not for a definitive solution but to see why the axception is raised in the first place  i usually have something like this   a very simple work around is to re-use the thread and not create and destroy them threads are pretty expensive you ll probably get a perf boost too.. kudos on the debugging though.,2012-05-11 09:35:10.873 UTC,634,10548888,for a long time i’ve noticed that the win64 version of my server application leak memory while the win32 version works fine with a relatively stable memory footprint the memory used by the 64 bit version increases regularly – maybe 20mb/day without any apparent reason needless to say fastmm4 did not report any memory leak for both of them the source code is identical between the 32bit and the 64bit version the application is built around the indy tidtcpserver component it is a highly multithreaded server connected to a database that processes commands sent by other clients made with delphi xe2  i spend a lot of time reviewing my own code and trying to understand why the 64 bit version leaked so much memory i ended up by using ms tools designed to track memory leaks like debugdiag and xperf and it seems there is a fundamental flaw in the delphi 64bit rtl that causes some bytes to be leaked each time a thread has detached from a dll this issue is particulary critical for highly multithreaded applications that must run 24/7 without being restarted  i reproduced the problem with a very basic project that is composed by an host application and a library both built with xe2 the dll is statically linked with the host app the host app creates threads that just call the dummy exported procedure and exit   here is the source code of the library    the host application uses a timer to create a thread that just call the exported procedure    here is some screenshots that show the leak using vmmap look at the red line named heap the following screenshots were taken within a 30 minutes interval  the 32 bit binary shows an increase of 16 bytes which is totally acceptable       the 64 bit binary shows an increase of 12476 bytes from 820k to 13296k which is more problematic        the constant increase of heap memory is also confirmed by xperf    xperf usage http://desmond.imageshack.us/himg825/scaled.php?server=825&amp;filename=soxperf.png&amp;res=landing   using debugdiag i was able to see the code path that was allocating the leaked memory    remy lebeau  helped me on the embarcadero forums  to understand what was happening      the second leak looks more like a definite bug  during thread  shutdown  startlib is being called which calls exitthreadtls to  free the calling  thread s tls memory block then calls halt0 to  call exitdll to raise  an exception that is caught by  delphiexceptionhandler to call allocateraiseframe  which  indirectly calls gettls and thus initthreadtls when it accesses  a  threadvar variable named exceptionobjectcount  that re-allocates the  tls  memory block of the calling thread that is still in the process  of being  shut down  so either startlib should not be calling  halt0 during dll_thread_detach  or delphiexceptionhandler should  not be calling allocateraiseframe when  it detects a  _texitdllexception being raised   it seems clear for me that there is an major flaw in the win64 way to handle threads shutdown a such behavior prohibits the development of any multithreaded server application that must run 27/7 under win64  so    what do you think of my conclusions ?  do any of you have a workaround for this issue ?   the test source code and the binaries  can be downloaded here   thanks for your contribution !   edit    qc report 105559  i m waiting for your votes :,0.02050473186119874,13,so,delphi|delphi-xe2|memory-leaks|win64,memory leak in the win64 delphi rtl during thread shutdown,2,flaws|memory leaks,0.2962334454059601

54450,for 32 bits applications valgrind + wine can be a working solution as well for windows apps if your app can be run under wine without any change then running it under valgrind + wine works well in my quite limited experience since your app works under linux i would guess that your app is likely to run under wine avoids very windows specific code which is not yet supported in wine  while you mentioned that this isn t preferred the  boehm garbage collector  can be used to detect memory leaks  simply put if the garbage collector is ever actually running then generally you have a memory leak  it s used this way by mozilla to detect memory leaks in firefox  there s the   tool on macos x i don t know if it exists elsewhere and i used to use a tool called memprof on linux  there s also valgrind which works on linux and is incredibly awesome but has a substantial performance hit and ostensibly on macos but i haven t tried it  i am unaware of any such tools on windows however  in newer versions of gcc there is something called  leak sanitizer  you just have to add   to compile command then you run your program normally and at the end if there was any leak you ll get summary in terminal of course   duma  is a cross-platform leak detection library which i use for many of my projects it s nice because you don t have to   any duma-specific header but just link in the library before you link in your system s libc which contains the memory allocation routines and after linking in libstdc++  it can be kind of tricky to set up especially when used with c++ projects but i think that it is well worth the time invested it has helped me to find a few memory leaks before that i might not have discovered otherwise and one case where i deleted an allocation twice  one note it s much easier if you build a static archive built by default on windows because it helps to reduce false positives that are actually caused by leaky runtimes   valgrind  is your  best friend  valgrind has a  plugin  for eclipse.sadly valgrind does not run on windows but it runs on mac osx *bsd and linux so i d consider that multi-platform :  valgrind does overwrite new/delete/malloc/free but not during compilation so you don t have to recompile if that s what you mean it interprets the binary so the performance suffer a bit during testing,2009-06-27 05:04:00.767 UTC,795,1052145,does anyone know where i can find a memory memory leak detection tool for c++ which can be either run in a command line or as an eclipse plug-in in windows and linux  i would like it to be easy to use  preferably one that doesn t overwrite new delete malloc or free  something like gdb if its gonna be in the command line but i don t remember that being used for detecting memory leaks  if there is a unit testing framework which does this automatically that would be great  this question is similar to other questions such as  memory leak detection under windows for gnu c/c++   however i feel it is different because those ask for windows specific solutions or have solutions which i would rather avoid  i feel i am looking for something a bit more specific here  suggestions don t have to fulfill all requirements but as many as possible would be nice  thanks  edit since this has come up by overwrite i mean anything which requires me to #include a library or which otherwise changes how c++ compiles my code if it does this at run time so that running the code in a different environment won t affect anything that would be great  also unfortunately i don t have a mac so any suggestions for that are unhelpful but thank you for trying  my desktop runs windows i have linux installed but my dual monitors don t work with it and i d rather not run linux in a vm although that is certainly an option  my laptop runs linux so i can use that tool on there although i would definitely prefer sticking to my desktop as the screen space is excellent for keeping all of the design documentation and requirements in view without having to move too much around on the desktop  note while i may try answers i won t mark one as accepted until i have tried the suggestion and it is satisfactory  edit2 i m not worried about the cross-platform compatibility of my code it s a command line application using just the c++ libraries,0.01761006289308176,14,so,c++|eclipse|memory-leaks|memory-management,g++ multi-platform memory leak detection tool,2,memory leaks|sanitization,0.2841234803199768

11527,if your application is meant to be obfuscated merging the dll with the exe first using ilmerge before obfuscation would provide absolute protection against dll hijacking and also eliminates unused code and gives you a standalone exe  couldn t you include the dll as a resource and write it out to where you want at run time then load the dll into the assembly? i did this once because we wanted to distribute as one .exe but i think it would also solve this problem wouldn t it?  if you have folder/data access priveledges you could write code to proactively go and look in the same places windows looks for your .dll prior to calling your own .dll or search the whole drive and you could compute a crc check for your legit dll or other pattern match to compare your legit.dll on located matching dll files and thus make sure no one else has hijacked you placed a file in a location that would be searched prior to your own location - or even any location this could take some research into the methodology under different versions of windows for the various orders of searches then if you find a hijacking attempt you could take some action depending on how sure you are that someone is trying to hijack your dll.. rename the faker.dll delete it notify the user notify admin don t call your dll etc  i had came across similar issue i had ended up writing my own logic for verifying the dll for me i was just using that dll in lgpl fashion i can t modify the dll but wanted to make sure that my application uses the genuine dll not the hi-jacked one  simple solution   while developing the application create md5 checksum of the dll and hardcode the hash in the application  everytime you start the application use the same logic to generate the md5 checksum of the dll file and compare it with the hardcoded one  you might be already aware but here is how to efficiently generate the checksum of a file see answer  https://stackoverflow.com/a/1177744/392850    better solution   generate hash of the dll with strong hashing algorithm and salt  generate rsa key value pair private key and public key  encrypt the hash of the dll with your private key  embed the public key encrypted hash and salt in your application  upon application start decrypt the encrypted hash with your public key  generate the hash again at runtime with the same salt and compare with the hash decrypted using the public key   if you have any certificate from trusted ca like verisign you can use that certificate instead of using rsa key value pair  this way even if someone replaces your dll with cracked dll the hash will not match and your application will know the hijacking attempt  this approach could is better than only giving dll a strong name because may be strong name verification can be disabled by running   hope this helps you or someone who wants to understand how digital signature things work internally  have a look at this  thread ....it might help you and give you insight....another thing you can certainly check out  easyhook  and intercept the api createremotethread and find out if the dll is one of the unauthorized ones... have a look at this  thread  that explains how to block against dll injection  robert  in fairness to jim s question about what kind of design would that be by answering instead of just saying it is what it is you could give us insight into the constraints our suggestions/solutions must fall within  put another way without knowing why the legacy code prevents you from doing it the right way it s hard to provide  ideal  workarounds to your problem  unless your architecture prevents the md5 checksum idea suggested by vishalgiri i d suggest taking his advice again though without knowing what applications call these dlls and why they can t be signed it s hard to know if this will work for you  my idea might be a lot simpler but can you not adjust your application to preload the dll from a predefined location? for example only allow it to load from the bin folder of your main applicaton and failing that - never try again?  see this link on how to load from a distinct path  http://www.chilkatsoft.com/p/p_502.asp   this may be faster than writing all the md5 checksum code even though i like that idea as well,2010-09-18 13:17:44.757 UTC,815,3741828,we have a .net 3.5 application with registered extensions how can we protect it against dll hijacking attacks?   because of legacy &amp design problems strong naming/signing is not an option right now   extra information if you don t know what dll hijacking is    what s dll hijacking - so    dll hijacking vulnerabilities,0.0196319018404908,16,so,.net|dll|security,how can i proctect my .net application against dll hijacking,5,hijack|attacks|hardcoded|protection|vulnerability,0.27816787362098694

51928,based on noseratio s  answer  i came up with the following  safe  versions of continuewith  when i update my code to use these safe versions i don t have anymore deadlocks  replacing all my existing continuewiths with these safecontinuewiths probably won t be too bad....it certainly seems easier and safer than re-writing them to use async/await  and when this executes under non-asp.net contexts wpf app unit tests etc. it will fall back to the standard continuewith behavior so i  should  have perfect backwards compatability  i m still not sure this is the best solution  it seems like this is a pretty heavy-handed approach that is necessary for code that seems so simple    with that said i m presenting this answer in case it triggers a great idea from somebody else  i feel like this can t be the ideal solution  new controller code   and then the actual implementation of safecontinuewith   you can set     there is also a global way to get this to work in your web.config add this to your     however i can t really recommend the global approach with that appsetting you  can t  use  /  in your application  try the following untested it s based on the idea that   executes the callback synchronously and thus should not result in  the same deadlock  this way we enter the   on a random pool thread    updated  based on the comments apparently it works and eliminates the deadlock further i d build a custom task scheduler on top of this solution and use it instead of   with very minimal changes to the existing code base,2014-05-13 18:26:52.11 UTC,730,23638886,we ve been running into a lot of deadlocks as part of exposing some of existing code over web api  i ve been able to distill the problem down to this very simple example that will hang forever   to me that code seems simple enough  this might seem a bit contrived but that s only because i ve tried simplifying the problem as much as possible  it seems having two continuewiths chained like this will cause the deadlock - if i comment out the first continuewith that isn t really doing anything anyway it will work just fine  i can also  fix  it by not giving the specific scheduler but that isn t a workable solution for us since our real code needs to be on the correct/original thread  here i ve put the two continuewiths right next to each other but in our real application there is a lot of logic that is happening and the continuewiths end up coming from different methods  i know i could re-write this particular example using async/await and it would simplify things and seems to fix the deadlock  however we have a ton of legacy code that has been written over the past few years - and most of it was written before async/await came out so it uses continuewith s heavily  re-writing all that logic isn t something we d like to do right now if we can avoid it  code like this has worked fine in all the other scenarios we ve run into desktop app silverlight app command line app etc. - it s just web api that is giving us these problems  is there anything that can be done  generically  that can solve this kind of deadlock?  i m looking for a solution that would hopefully not involve re-writing all continuewith s to use async/await   update   the code above is the entire code in my controller  i ve tried to make this reproducible with the minimal amount of code  i ve even done this in a brand new solution  the full steps that i did   from visual studio 2013 update 1 on windows 7 with .net framework 4.5.1 create a new project using the asp.net web application template  select web api as the template on the next screen  replace the get method in the auto-created valuescontroller with the example given in my original code  hit f5 to start the app and navigate to ./api/values - the request will hang forever  i ve tried hosting the web site in iis as well instead of using iis express  i also tried updating all the various nuget packages so i was on the latest of everything   the web.config is untouched from what the template created  specifically it has this,0.012328767123287671,9,so,asp.net-web-api|c#|deadlock|task-parallel-library,deadlock with continuewiths in webapi,1,deadlock,0.24656078219413757

59528,we finally seem to have identified the root cause of the problem we had this is a answer to what specifically caused that problem as it s not unlikely this may be of use for others  tldr  the problem was caused by a bug in the jdk which is now fixed and will realease with jdk 8u152  link to the bug report   the whole story  we continued to monitor our application s memory performance after i first posted this question and the xx:nativememorytracking suggested by  vsminkov  helped greatly with narrowing down and pinpointing the area in memory which was leaking  what we found was that the tread - arenas area was growing indefinitely as this kind of leak was something we were pretty sure we hadn t experienced earlier we started testing with earlier versions of java to see if this was introduced at some specific point  after going back down to java 8u73 the leak wasn t there and although being forced to use an older jdk version wasn t optimal at least we had a way to get around the problem for now  some weeks later while running on update 73 we noticed that the application was still leaking and once again we started searching for a culprit we found the problem was now located in the class - malloc area  at this point we were almost certain the leak was not our application s fault and we were considering contacting oracle to report the issue as a potential bug but then a colleague of mine stumbled across this bug report on the jdk hotspot compiler  link to the bug report   the bug description is very similar to what we saw according to what is written in the report the memory leak has been present since the java 8 release and after testing with an early release of jdk 8u152 we are now fairly certain the leak is fixed after 5 days of running our application s memory footprint now seems close to 100% stable the class malloc area still grows slightly but it s now going up at a rate of about 100 kb a day compared to several mbs earlier and having tested for only 5 days i can t say for sure it won t stabilize eventually  i can t say for certain but it seems likely the issues we had with the class malloc and thread arenas growing were related at any point both problems are gone in update 152 unfortunately the update doesn t seem to be scheduled for official release until late 2017 but our testing with the early release seems promising so far  i ll try partially answer your question  the basic strategy i m trying to stick to in such situations is to make a monitoring of max/used/peak values for each memory pool available opened files sockets buffer pools number of threads  etc  there might be a leakage of socket connections/opened files/threads which you can miss  in your case it looks like you are really have a problem with native memory leakage which is quite nasty and hard to find  you may try to profile memory take a look at   roots and find out which ones is   global references it may help you to find out which classes may be not collected for example this is a  common problem  in   which may require explicit component disposal  to inspect jvm internal memory usage  which is not belongs to heap/off-heap memory      is very handy it allows you to track thread stack sizes gc/compiler overheads and much more the greatest thing about it is that you can create a baseline in any point of time and then track memory diffs since baseline was made   you can also use     command to generate this reports  and.. you can go deeper and inspect     and/or     content,2016-08-24 08:05:16.85 UTC,1033,39117716,i am working with a team developing a java gui application running on a 1gb linux target system  we have a problem where the memory used by our java process grows indefinitely until linux finally kills the java process  our heap memory is healthy and stable we have profiled our heap extensively we also used memorymxbean to monitor the application s non heap memory usage since we believed the problem might lie there however what we see is that reported heap size + reported non heap size stays stable  here is an example of how the numbers might look when running the application on our target system with 1gb ram heap and non heap reported by memorymxbean total memory used by java process monitored using linux s top command resident memory  at startup   200 mb heap committed  40 mb non heap committed  320 mb used by java process   after 1 day   200 mb heap committed  40 mb non heap committed  360 mb used by java process   after 2 days   200 mb heap committed  40 mb non heap committed  400 mb used by java process   the numbers above are just a cleaner representation of how our system performs but they are fairly accurate and close to reality as you can see the trend is clear after a couple of weeks running the application the linux system starts having problems due to running out of system memory things start slowing down after a few more hours the java process is killed  after months of profiling and trying to make sense of this we are still at a loss i feel it is hard to find information about this problem as most discussions end up explaining the heap or other non heap memory pools like metaspace etc.  my questions are as follows    if you break it down what does the memory used by a java process include? in addition to the heap and non heap memory pools    which other potential sources are there for memory leaks? native code? jvm overhead? which ones are in general the most likely culprits?    how can one monitor / profile this memory? everything outside the heap + non heap is currently somewhat of a black box for us    any help would be greatly appreciated,0.010648596321393998,11,so,java|linux|memory|memory-leaks,java process s memory grows indefinitely but memorymxbean reports stable heap and non-heap size,1,memory leaks,0.21347635984420776

53074,a simple way to find handle leaks is to log everything  every time you obtain a handle log that you obtained it as well as any other details about the circumstances  every time you release a handle log that you released it  include both times the actual handle just some hex  then you get a log that looks like this just for example   picking through this by hand you can see that you obtained handle 0xd0d0 when nlineno was 7 and it never got released  it s not much but it does help and if the going gets tough you can even try logging stack traces at each obtain/release  also if the log is always reliably produced like that you can start putting in breakpoints based on the actual values e.g break at a point in the program when the handle is 0xd0d0 so you can see what s happening to it  if it s more practical you can start wrapping your handles inside the program itself e.g a   of all obtained handles along with any details about when they were obtained and you can effectively start hacking your program to keep track of what it s doing then undo all your changes once you fixed it  hope that helps - it s part of the reason i tend to at least keep a   of everything i obtain so if worst comes to worst you can iterate over them on shutdown and release them all and log a big fix this! message!  try the free  process explorer  from microsoft  it will display all the open handles for a process along with information such as name for file mutex event etc handles  it will also highlight newly created and closed handles so if you step through a loop of your code and refresh the display you can see the exact handles that were leaked  i would suggest that you try  intel parallel inspector  in order to identify the memory leaks and where they are occurring  there is a trial download if you wish to try it  try adding a   on the socket handles after the   also try adding a sleep for about 100ms only for a test and see how it goes  let s say you acquired socket correctly   but then you can t connect so   in that case you should close that acquired socket handle   you have two lines so i guess that you call this function twice once for each line so that s why two leaked handles,2011-04-14 11:53:32.19 UTC,542,5662798,we are developing an application in which we are using a winsock-based sime socket approach to communicate with an outside module our requirement is to make sure that the connection will always be on so for that reason we continuously retry to connect every 1 minute whenever we get disconnected  our problem starts here we have observered that on every retry of socket reconnect it is leaking exactly two windows handles we have tried so many options but none of them are working which handles could be leaking and how could we go about identifying the culprit?  following is the code that we are using right now,0.014760147601476014,8,so,c++|memory-leaks|mfc|sockets|winsock,tracking down the source of handle leaks in winsock mfc application,1,memory leaks,0.2056855857372284
20338,i ve found what causing memory leak in my case maybe this will help others with similar issue    this problem was caused probably by this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=972515   i have some charts on my page and few of them are a spark-line i was using this code for animations  source    in some cases   was returning   and cause memory leak while animating removing above code from my charts fix the issue  i’ve just been fed up with ff because of all of the memory leaks etc i ve been running v16 forever because whenever i’ve tried to upgrade to newer versions they’d all pretty much just crash after 30 minutes of heavy use and not a single version of ff that i’ve ever used has ever fixed the memory leak problems not a single one   i actually installed a tiny batch file on quicklaunch so i could quickly kill ff at the point it’s consumed all of my ram so i could then start over with “restore session” to automatically reload all of my previous tabs after trying every “solution” to the leak problem that’s the only one that ever did me any good apparently the arrogant tards at mozilla would rather tweak the ui to death rather than make a browser that actually works they’re worse than even microsoft because microsoft has to listen to their customers sooner or later or go broke whereas nonprofits can just drift along forever  at any rate i just finished installing pm including importing everything from ff with their little importer program and everything went flawlessly including all settings and the plethora of add-ons i use the only difficulty was getting roboform attached which i can’t live without i did finally dumb around and got the roboform taskbar program to attach roboform to pm which then worked flawlessly it is however necessary for the roboform taskbar program to run all the time for roboform to continue to work on pm but this is a very small price to pay to ditch ff forever  i ve used pm for a week now opening/closing/keeping hundreds of tabs a day and i’ve been stunned at how much faster pm is than ff as well as the very small memory footprint occupied by pm vs ff even after a week s heavy usage pm has not grown beyond 1 gb and even better when i close tabs all of the ram is given back  basically pm is what ff ought to be even better the genius behind pale moon mark straver has committed to keeping the pm ui fundamentally unmolested i’ll be installing pm instead of ff on all of my client’s computers in the future as well!  btw all of the recommended fixes for the firefox memory leak problems are a sick joke not one of them works and plugins do not cause the memory leaks! firefox does! how do i know? because i switched to pale moon importing everything exactly like it was in firefox and guess what? no memory leaks in pale moon! oh and i use adblock plus flash java donottrackme betterprivacy cookieculler downloadhelper element hiding helper ie view viewabout visited and roboform so none of those is causing the firefox memory leak problems,2014-03-25 15:10:55.25 UTC,709,22638663,i m fighting whole day trying to find cause of strange memory leak which only exist in firefox 28 and only on windows 7 - chrome linux / win 7 is fine as well as that same version of firefox for linux it s also fine on older version of firefox for windows  it s even more bizarre because that same functionality is working fine for ff 28 / win 7 with three different data-sets but for other two it s leaking and crashing browser.. and everything is completely fine for all five sets on other platforms / browsers..  have somebody idea what s going on? or could help me get some proper tracking tools or maybe know some bug reports for similar issues on mozilla page?   and i m sure that this is not caused by add-ons - i ve installed fresh copy of firefox and even run with safe mode on - it s still crashing.,0.022566995768688293,16,so,firefox|javascript|memory-leaks,firefox 28 only win7 crash after js memory leak,3,flaws|weakness|memory leaks,0.20441345870494843

30413,okay so in the end it seems it s quite complex sql deadlocks and data problems heightened it seems by anti-virus software that was locking up or choking on a file  turning off the anti-virus reduced the problems but we still need to resolve the underlying data issues,2010-10-06 14:52:30.053 UTC,588,3873801,some background info   we have several websites running on a 64-bit machine with iis6  these websites all have the same core code but different skins and content  we have a sql 2005 database which is fairly heavily used throughout the site  historically we ve used sql stored procs but have been gradually transitioning to nhibernate the majority of our code uses nhibernate now but not all  these sites have been running fine on our live web server for a while although we get a few errors a day regarding sql connectivity / deadlocking   last thursday we noticed the sites going very slow then checking task manager revealed one of the websites was hogging over 1.6gb of memory ever since then we ve been restarting the app and watching it slowly increase in size over the course of the day  we apparently have a memory leak or at least that s the effect but i m losing hair trying to work out how to trace it  it only appears to be happening on this one website even though as far as i am aware nothing had changed in the code before it started happenning it is however our busiest website so it could be a traffic issue  debug diagnostics hasn t revealed any issues  refreshing certain pages very quickly causes the memory to jump up rapidly then fall slightly but all the time the gradual progression is upwards  i cannot replicate the issue on our test servers or locally probably because the traffic has something to do with it  my suspicion is that the problem lies in database connectivity / locking however i m not sure how that would cause the problem specified  any ideas?   edit   okay so not exactly sure i ve found the problem but we re getting closer it s definately sql related the error log reveals lots of errors since last thursday  it all happened after we ran some windows updates on our servers one of the updates failed on the sql server so not sure if this caused some problems  the warnings we re getting are   sql server has encountered xx occurences of i/o requests taking longer than 15 seconds to complete on file . tempdb.mdf   where xx is anything between 17 and 90! does that sound like a deadlocking issue?  followed by the following erors   unable to complete login process due to delay in opening server connection   these coincide with our log times for when the websites have been blipping  we ve increased the page file size on sql server to the recommended size as it was set to a max of 4gb but recommended was 12gb i think we may need to roll back the windows updates we did on thursday if that doesn t fix it  unfortunately i can t get into activity monitor as it tells me timeout expired!   edit   okay after a reboot i m into activity monitor how many sleeping processes would you say would be normal? we have roughly 127 sleeping that s serving over 10 websites  if there is a deadlock or timeout issue will nhibernate not clean up its connections properly,0.015306122448979591,9,so,asp.net|iis|memory-leaks|nhibernate,how can i trace an apparent memory leak in an asp.net application,3,virus|deadlock|memory leaks,0.1861046701669693
45365,it only happens when you use the eclipse exporter runnable jar file and then choose package required libraries into generated jar  then the eclipse jar-in-jar classloader will be used which uses an urlclassloader which will produce a memory leak according to this question: how long are resources used file descriptor and memory for java temporary files jar_cache####.tmp?   something in your application is using file.deleteonexit but since your application never exists java has to keep track of all those files because they need to be deleted when it finally exits which never happens.i suggest you find out which part of your application does this using the debugger and then find an alternative  there is also a clue in the pathname of the files /tmp/jar_cachexxxx.tmp  apparently those files are created when a urlclassloader downloads a remote jar file and loads it  if you have millions of these strings that implies you are doing that far too often  this is a long-standing and well known bug that has been reported to sun/oracle many times over the years  the current bug number is  jdk-4872014     the issue is that each time you use the delete-on-exit api the file gets stored into a    since in a long-running server your code rarely intentionally exits the map can grow without bounds if you are doing this with lots of temporary files  essentially the api is not usable with long-running servers because it s not really intended to be used that way  if you need this functionality you need to implement it yourself and run the cleanup on a schedule with some way to know which files can be deleted,2016-10-18 22:34:15.313 UTC,433,40119188,i have a java application running 24/7 it has a connection to a mysql server and a timertask is running akka i m running into outofmemoryerror after a week or less of operation and the heap dump reveals a linkedhashmap with over 4 millions of strings they have a gc root of java.io.deleteonexithook using 800 mb of heap  all the strings are something like /tmp/jar_cachexxxx.tmp  this problem is consistent in two machines running openjdk runtime environment build 1.8.0_101-b13 the jdbc driver is the one provided on maven mysql-connector-java version 5.1.38 and i m using the connection pool bonecp version 0.8.0  anyone has an idea about this leak?   update -- 5/12/16   the problem has been solved after we ve changed the compiler for the project we noticed that eclipse jar creator was the only thing that has any relation with jar cache so after we compiled the project with maven the memory leak was gone,0.011547344110854504,5,so,akka|java|memory-leaks|out-of-memory,memory leak on deleteonexithook,1,memory leaks,0.18491148948669434
36940,this is now resolved it required that the provisioning profiles be regenerated and synchronised back to xcode took a few attempts to get this to work it is also worth noting that i had to enable data protection within my target capabilities in xcode and also from the apple developer portal s app id edit i then had to make sure i completely regenerated all of my provisioning profiles  also iexplorer is a bit deceptive  it will show you the file structure but i was unable to preview or copy the files off the device once it was locked and a passcode was applied to the ipad  as i understand it data protection will only work if the user set a passcode on his device http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4175?viewlocale=en_us&amp;locale=en_us,2014-04-17 07:59:16.333 UTC,338,23127687,i have an app that i have enabled for data protection both on the developer portal and in the project capabilities section of my target i have created new provisioning profiles and synchronised them to my account in xcode yet still when i build my project and download files i can view them using iexplorer a tool for browsing the file system on ios devices am i missing something? i understand that the files are inaccessible when the device is locked and has a passcode i was under the impression that this is all now handled automatically using xcode 5.1 so there are no entitlements.plist files or any coding to handle this when my files get written  update   this code is being used to create and write my files as they download i m wondering if   has its own internal file creation methods this is the utils code    if i debug this i can see that it uses   as its preferred protection technique but does it? or does   just scrap all that work?  update update  appears you do need to create the file for   to handle so i am still stuck why does the data protection not seem to work,0.020710059171597635,7,so,data-protection|encryption|ios|security|xcode5.1,how can i test ios data protection,1,data protection,0.18077808618545532
46393,the issue as mentioned above is that the decryption logic does not properly handle the case where the input cipher is a zero-length array  a ticket was created for this   http://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feedback/details/678150/denial-of-service-in-tripledescryptoserviceprovider   note it seems to work ok when running .net framework 4.0  the final block is where the padding is in your example the single space is the first and last block des/triple des is a 64 bit block cipher the ciphet text should should be a multiple of 8 bytes 64 bits   i don t have the environment to test it but did you try playing with padding options ? padding with more spaces won t do because padding won t match   a common padding scheme is  pkcs5  for a single byte that encrypted to the space caracter your plain text should be in hex    but in your code sample a base64 input is expected wich means that your input string must be    a multiple of 12 caracters  a valid base64 string   any other string can be rejected  the   value looks like a mac which means that your input plain text should be followed by a hash md5 in your code it is there to help you detect changes to the cipher text it is usefull when you encrypt binary data if you can easily detect garbled plain text you can set it to false,2011-06-22 21:18:22.72 UTC,383,6446700,we have a legacy asp.net site which uses the encryption methods here   http://www.codekeep.net/snippets/af1cd375-059a-4175-93d7-25eea2c5c660.aspx   when we call the following method the page loads very slowly and eventually connection reset is returned   if the method is called multiple times in subsequent page requests  the application pool goes down   this is occurring on a windows 2008 server running .net framework v3.5  i narrowed the problem down to the   call  note on cassini i do not get a connection timeout instead the following exception is thrown   calling decrypt for other strings causes no problems in any environment  why is this happening? is it a bug in tripledescryptoserviceprovider?  obviously i could filter the cipherstring to reject   and avoid this particular issue however i am worried that some other cipherstring values that i am not suspecting will cause the dos   update 2011.06.28   the following is the minimal code to reproduce the issue,0.013054830287206266,5,so,cryptography|denial-of-service|encryption|tripledes,tripledescryptoserviceprovider - vulnerable to denial of service,2,vulnerability|denial of service,0.17058530449867249
